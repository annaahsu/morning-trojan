We’re dedicating the entirety of today’s coverage to the Monterey Park shooting. Here’s what you need to know. 1. The massacre at a Monterey Park ballroom dance studio left 10 dead and another 10 injured Saturday night. The shooting took place about an hour after a popular Lunar New Year Festival ended near the Star Ballroom Dance Studio, which originally stoked fears that the shooting had targeted the Asian community. Staff / Los Angeles Times 2. Authorities identified 72-year-old Huu Can Tran as the suspect. Tran was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in a van on Sunday, leaving police puzzling over his motive. Monterey Park’s mayor said Tran might’ve frequented the dance studio. Staff / Los Angeles Daily News 3. The shooting was the nation’s fifth mass killing this month, and the deadliest since 21 people were killed at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas in May. LA County Sheriff Robert Luna said authorities found a semi-automatic pistol with an extended magazine and a second handgun in the van where Tran died. Andrew Dalton and Jae C. Hong / Associated Press 4. Tran intended to shoot another dance studio after his first attack; 26-year-old Brandon Tsay stopped that from happening. The third-generation operator of the Lai Lai Ballroom &amp; Studio in Alhambra, Tsay was credited with wrestling Tran’s gun away from him after he entered the studio. Victoria Kim / The New York Times 5. California Democrats quickly called for gun legislation reform. It’s uncertain whether the state, which already has the nation’s strictest gun laws, would be able to pass legislation that won’t be struck down by conservative judges that have already chipped away at past bills. Tran’s semi-automatic pistol is illegal to possess under current law. Sameea Kamal / CalMatters You’re all caught up. Thanks for reading Morning, Trojan, and have a good day.

It’s Monday, and I’m reading about how a woman got trapped in a Lake Tahoe gondola overnight. The very last line of that article reads “[She] did not find the survival kit in the gondola,” which sent me, because I can’t tell if it’s an ill-advised diss or just weird editing. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] 23andMe is accused in a class-action lawsuit of neglecting to notify customers with Jewish and Chinese heritage that they were specifically targeted in a data breach last year. The lawsuit alleges that the San Francisco-based genetic testing company only discovered the data breach six months after it happened, and that a hacker leaked the names, addresses and birth dates of over 1 million customers of Jewish ancestry — later offering to sell data about “wealthy families serving Zionism” — and released profile information for 100,000 Chinese customers at the request of someone on an internet forum. Staff / The New York Times 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The LA City Council is looking to crack down on thieves stealing copper wiring from public light fixtures, a phenomenon that’s surged over the last year and has reportedly cost the city at least $17 million in repairs. Two council members introduced a motion that would, most notably, allow people to email a hotline to report thefts in return for monetary compensation. “The city, quite literally, is being stripped for parts,” the motion read. Angie Orellana Hernandez / Los Angeles Times 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] When Gov.

Those gifts included all-expenses-paid trips to Las Vegas with prostitutes, rides on private jets and hundreds of thousands of dollars in casino chips. Frank Stoltze / LAist 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] California’s DMV rejects vanity plates that it deems too inappropriate for the road using a set of policies that are somewhat hilarious in and of themselves. For instance, the number 69 is banned wholesale from California license plates, except for on vehicles from that year. But the real fun comes from the actual rejected plates. Here are a few of my favorites from 2023: “HONKY69,” “EVMYASS,” “SESYTOY,” “THTBCH” and “ELON 69.” And though I’d like to clarify that I do not condone these, the two that really got me were “RACIST” and “LKENACI.” Like, what was the thought process?

Tomo Chien & Yana Savitsky January 12, 2025 The school hasn’t released an official tally. (Jordan Renville) p span[style*=\"font-size\"] At least 42 USC students, faculty, and staff have lost their homes to Los Angeles’ devastating wildfires, a Morning, Trojan estimate found. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] That number is based on GoFundMe listings, social media, and interviews with victims. Still, the sum is likely a dramatic undercount, and does not include people who’ve been temporarily displaced but whose homes remain undamaged. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC is one of the largest private employers in LA with 22,000 full-time employees and 47,000 students, many of whom are certain to live in the nearly 40,000-acre burn zone. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Around a quarter in the estimate are students who lost homes where they live during breaks or commute to school from. The rest is split evenly between faculty and staff. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A university spokesperson said it is too soon to know the exact number of displaced community members, citing the rapidly changing situation. The school is not aware of any deaths or critical injuries, she added. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Multiple sources with knowledge of high-level discussions at USC said officials are producing preliminary tallies based on self-reports and HR address data, Morning, Trojan previously reported . Those sources asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak to the press. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The spring semester will begin in-person as planned Monday, USC officials said, noting that “campuses are safe and not located near the wildfires.” Several professors said they plan to offer virtual classes — or cancel them altogether — during the first week of school, though they made those decisions on an individual basis. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A university email Monday morning asked “severely impacted” faculty and staff to report the disruption at this form . p span[style*=\"font-size\"] As of Sunday evening, the Palisades and Eaton fires continued their march across LA, destroying more than 12,000 structures and leaving at least 24 dead, the LA Times reported . The Palisades fire is 13% contained, and the Eaton is 27%, according to the Watch Duty app . p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Officials warned that strong winds could fuel further “ explosive fire growth ” Monday night through Wednesday. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] In an email to employees who reported being displaced from their homes, the university offered a discounted rate of $90 plus tax per night at the USC Hotel, with no parking fees or pet limit. The email also directed employees to the Biltmore Hotel downtown, which is offering a discount of $179 plus tax per night and a $45 self-parking fee. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The university is offering a wildfire and air quality hotline — (213) 740-6291 — and an email address to answer questions. Keck Medicine employees have a dedicated hotline at (323) 865-9897, email , and website as well. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The Lorenzo Apartments near USC are offering furnished units for $150 per night, and Airbnb is offering free temporary housing. Some clothing retailers at the Century City mall are offering discounts for fire victims. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC’s email to displaced employees also directs them to counseling services at the WorkWell Center .

I had the chance to visit the Getty Center and Getty Villa , both of which I’d highly recommend if you haven’t already gone. Admission is free, but parking is $20 at both museums. And now, onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. An estimated 46,000 LA County residences didn’t have power as of Sunday night — many of them since Friday. The LA Department of Water and Power said it was working through the “time-consuming” process of restoring equipment damaged by the heavy rain and wind in this weekend’s historic storm. Laura Newberry / Los Angeles Times 2. Trucking advocates are worried that California’s ambitious decarbonization goals are going to put small trucking companies out of business. The state wants all drayage trucks — vehicles that make short trips to and from seaports — to be zero-emissions within 12 years. But the cost of such trucks and their charging stations is prohibitively expensive for small and independent operators. Gabriela Aoun Angueira / Grist 3. USC will pay $13.05 million to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging the school mismanaged faculty and staff retirement plans by billing duplicate service costs and offering underperforming investment choices. The plaintiffs first filed the suit in 2016, accusing the university of violating the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, which protects the rights of participants in retirement and health plans. Hank Yang / Daily Trojan 4. California mass transit systems are asking the state for a bailout. Post-pandemic ridership is still lagging far behind former levels, gutting revenue as $69 billion in federal pandemic emergency funding to keep public transit operating is expected to run out within two years. State legislators will have their work cut out for them in finding room in the budget while staring down a $22.5 billion deficit. Christine Mai-Duc / The Wall Street Journal 5. Road rage is on the rise in LA. Official incidents reported to the police — typically assault with a weapon because of something that happened while driving, not just a middle finger — were up 21.1% in 2022 from the previous year, the highest count in over a decade. Men are overwhelmingly involved in the incidents, which likely won’t come as a surprise to any of us. Carter Hyde / Crosstown You’re all caught up.

I had a wisdom tooth extraction the other day and have been generally moping about since watching our embarrassing loss to Tulane. Here are the 10 USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know from this past week. 1. Northern California is bracing for a brutal storm Wednesday, expecting more flash floods, mudslides and power outages after a brief respite on Tuesday from a New Year’s Eve deluge that killed at least one person. Jill Tucker and Joaquin Palomino / San Francisco Chronicle 2. A security guard was fatally shot last week at the off-campus Lorenzo apartments, a housing complex for USC students. A 31-year-old who trespassed on the property then shot the guard was charged with one count of murder and possession of a firearm by a felon. Tomoki Chien / Daily Trojan 3. USC football fell in an embarrassing loss to Tulane in the Cotton Bowl on Monday. It was a mess. A total defensive catastrophe. Complete humiliation. That’s all I’ve got for this one. Adam Jasper / Annenberg Media 4. Rick Singer, the disgraced college admissions counselor at the center of the Operation Varsity Blues scandal, is set to be sentenced Wednesday in a Boston court. Singer pleaded guilty to blatantly rigging the admissions system for wealthy clients whose children sought to attend schools including USC, Yale and Georgetown. Tovia Smith / NPR 5. Hundreds of former detainees in LA County juvenile camps and detention halls alleged they experienced horrific sexual abuse at the hands of detention officers over a period of five decades in a lawsuit last week. Richard Winton / Los Angeles Times 6. Rep. Kevin McCarthy failed to secure the House speakership Tuesday, facing a humiliating mutiny from his party’s far-right clique. The Bakersfield Republican will hope for a better result in voting Wednesday. Catie Edmondson / The New York Times 7. California law enforcement seized enough fentanyl in 2022 to kill the entire population of North America twice over. That was a nearly sixfold increase from the previous year, marking an alarming rise of the synthetic opioid that’s 50 times more potent than heroin and often surreptitiously laced in other drugs. Scooty Nickerson / The Mercury News 8. Some California colleges have begun experimenting with restorative justice programs in cases of sexual assault and harassment. The programs consist of voluntary facilitated conferences where the perpetrator apologizes and takes steps that the survivor requests — like quitting extracurricular activities so the two don’t run into each other. Oden Taylor and Felicia Mello / CalMatters 9. Negotiators representing Western states dependent on the Colorado River are increasingly struggling to work out water use agreements. One common goal: Keep water politics out of the national culture wars, lest “spite lawns” begin popping up in red regions. Rachel Monroe / The New Yorker 10. An 18-year-old pilot made an emergency landing on a highway after his engine failed en route to Riverside Municipal airport with his grandma and cousins. The kid, who’s only had his pilot’s license for three months (and plans to keep flying), said the ordeal gave him “a little more confidence in those kinds of situations.” Noah Goldberg / Los Angeles Times You’re all caught up.

The University of California Board of Regents OK’d UCLA’s defection to the Big Ten — provided that the school pay UC Berkeley a multimillion-dollar sum.

It’s Tuesday, and I’m reading about the steepest street in California . Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Prepare for a kitten boom. Every summer, warm weather sends stray cats “into heat,” spurring a wave of new births and legions of feral kittens. The Humane Society of America likens it to a “natural disaster.” An Oakland animal shelter director called it “draining.” But things aren’t likely to get any better: Experts have noted that kitten season seems to be starting earlier and lasting longer as climate change causes milder winters. In LA — which is home to millions of feral cats known to wreak havoc on local biodiversity on top of the headache they cause for animal shelters — that change only exacerbates a perennial problem. Sachi Mulkey / Grist 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Fresno is leading California’s population growth, but for an unexpected reason: It’s simply losing fewer people than the rest of the state. While the Fresno area’s population grew by about 0.4% from July 2022 to July 2023, the state’s overall numbers fell by 0.2% — no doubt driven by losses in LA and the Bay Area. The Central Valley city also managed to tally a slightly higher birth rate than more populous areas of California. “We’re one of the last places in California where you can buy a home between $400,000 and $500,000 that’s about 2,000 square feet,” one real estate agent said. Christian Leonard / San Francisco Chronicle 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Housing advocates are homing in on one of their long-time foes: the California Coastal Commission, a state agency that scrutinizes anything built, demolished, dug up or fixed along the state’s 840-mile coastline. The commission tends to be stingy with the permits it issues in an effort to prevent the coast from becoming overdeveloped. But Democratic lawmakers want to erode its power. One bill would exempt certain kinds of dense housing with units for lower income residents from the commission’s oversight. Another would make an exception for accessory dwelling units. And yet another would exempt a broad swath of San Francisco entirely. Ben Christopher / CalMatters 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] It’s called the “LA left turn,” and it’s notoriously dangerous. Imagine: You’re about to make an unprotected left on a busy street. When the light turns green, you slowly creep into the middle of the intersection, signal and wait for oncoming traffic to clear. Then the light turns red — and you floor it, swinging wildly into the turn so you don’t get T-boned by perpendicular traffic. The move actually isn’t illegal: It’s just risky. A study in San Francisco found that in 2019, 4 in 10 traffic deaths were caused by left turns. But it’s a hard problem to fix. For one, left-turn signals are expensive to install. And many LA streets are too narrow to accommodate long lines of left-turners. Paula Mejía / SFGate 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] When the weather turns warm in a California mountain town, all hell breaks loose. Black bears descend on the small village of Pine Mountain Club. They smash windows, tear out doors and rip out roof tiles. They demolish cars to get to cookie crumbs between the seats. They sneak into homes to pull old pizza out of refrigerators. They even defecate on the counters. Blame urban growth, wildfires and drought for forcing more human-bear interactions. But also, maybe blame the people who keep feeding them. “I love bears; they’re just big puppy dogs,” said one resident known to feed the bears. “Getting along with these critters is the right thing to do. It pleases the Lord.” Louis Sahagún / Los Angeles Times p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Correction: USC’s women’s basketball team will play Texas A&M Corpus Christi on Saturday, not Sunday as I wrote in yesterday’s newsletter."},{"slug":"a-loophole-enables-student-housing-boom","title":"A loophole enables student housing boom","date":1711033591000,"web_exclusive":false,"content":".bh__byline_wrapper .bh__byline_social_wrapper .bh__byline_social_wrapper > * + * @media (min-width: 768px) .bh__byline_social_wrapper } A loophole enables student housing boom Tomo Chien March 21, 2024 p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Good morning. It’s Thursday, and I’m reading about the coveted Malibu McDonald’s . Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Developers are exploiting a loophole to rapidly convert the historic Black and Latino neighborhood around USC into dense student housing. In 2008, LA officials imposed regulations meant to preserve the neighborhood’s low-density character by limiting the number of “habitable rooms” a building can have. But a quirk of the law says that if one room is a combination kitchen-living room, the rest can be bedrooms — which lets developers cram tiny bedrooms into their student-minded properties that essentially force out the neighborhood’s long-time residents. Doug Smith and Angie Orellana Hernandez / Los Angeles Times 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] State lawmakers introduced a bill that would compel some public California colleges to enforce their free speech policies. The proposal — a direct reaction to a protest at UC Berkeley where demonstrators broke a window and roughed-up Jewish students — would require the California State University and community college systems to enforce their policies that regulate violence, harassment and discrimination that interferes with other peoples’ free speech. The bill’s author suggested withholding state funding to ensure schools comply, though the legislation doesn’t impact the University of California system, where lawmakers have more limited oversight. Sophia Bollag / San Francisco Chronicle 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] LA law enforcement officials are looking to stymie violent crime by sending more cases to federal agencies that can impose stricter sentences. The initiative was born out of frustration with a rising number of brazen robberies where criminals brandish firearms: Violent crime in California has trended down in the last few years, but the number of assaults and homicides involving guns has gone up. Officials said they’ll take a “thoughtful approach” when deciding which cases to hand to the feds — an effort to avoid disproportionately jailing Black and Latino people — but the specifics of that approach aren’t clear. Nathan Solis / Los Angeles Times 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Gov. Gavin Newsom’s signature mental health initiative eked out a narrow win with just 50.2% of the vote. The initiative, called Proposition 1, includes a $6.4 billion bond to house and treat homeless people struggling with mental illness and addiction. It’s a centerpiece of Newsom’s tenure that was supposed to pass easily: Prop. 1’s campaign pumped $13.6 million into a television and digital ad blitz, and there was no meaningful opposition. Voter turnout might have something to do with the stunningly close call — Republicans disproportionately showed out in the midterms. It could also be because people just don’t like Newsom . Shawn Hubler / The New York Times 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] This should’ve been a triumphant week for Shohei Ohtani. The modern-day baseball legend played his first game as an LA Dodger, starting a $700 million contract that makes him one of the highest-paid athletes in history. Instead, he’s roiled in scandal. Last night, the Dodgers fired Ohtani’s translator for associating with an illegal bookmaker who’s under federal investigation. But in a bizarre twist, a bank account that belongs to Ohtani allegedly wired the bookmaker at least $4.5 million to pay off the translator’s debts. It’s not clear from conflicting reports whether Ohtani knew about the wire or if he is, as his lawyers said, “the victim of a massive theft.” Lindsey Adler / The Wall Street Journal p span[style*=\"font-size\"] List a party in the newsletter"},{"slug":"a-much-needed-nonprofit-structure-fires-rolling-blackouts-and-more","title":"A much-needed nonprofit, structure fires, rolling blackouts and more.","date":1662476148000,"web_exclusive":false,"content":"*|MC_PREVIEW_TEXT|* View this email in your browser Morning, Trojan.

(Melissa Chen / Daily Trojan) The leading contender in the Los Angeles mayoral race, Rep. Karen Bass, is caught up in a scandal involving the former dean of USC’s social work program. Bass accepted admission and a $95,000 scholarship at the school midway through her first congressional term in 2011. Prosecutors asserted that former dean Marilyn Flynn offered Bass admission and tuition hoping for assistance in advancing legislation favorable to the university. Bass is not under criminal investigation, and maintains that she was unaware of any quid pro quo — but is becoming increasingly tied to the federal prosecution of Flynn and former L.A. County supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas in a separate case. (Matt Hamilton / Los Angeles Times) 🌴 In L.A. Rep. Karen Bass and businessman Rick Caruso, the two Los Angeles mayoral candidates, criticized each other’s dealings at USC on Thursday. Caruso, for his part, called for more consistency from Bass’ camp on her acceptance of the $95,000 scholarship to the school of social work. Bass accused Caruso of covering up sexual abuse at the university during his tenure as chair of the board of trustees.

Seven stories for today, Sept. 22 📍 On campus A team of undergrads launched an app called “Mist” on Monday, where users anonymously compliment others on campus and then have the option of connecting via direct message. Personally, my question is whether this will turn out to be a compliment-disguised-as-booty-call app, or a genuine form of social media. ( Staff report / Annenberg Media ) USC took the spotlight during a televised L.A. mayoral debate where Rep. Karen Bass and developer Rick Caruso each traded barbs about the opposing candidate’s involvement in USC scandals. ( Hillel Aron / Courthouse News Service ) 🌴 In L.A. A 15-year-old male student at the STEM Academy of Hollywood overdosed from pills that police believe were laced with fentanyl. He was found unconscious by his mother in their home, though he was treated at the hospital and is expected to survive. The boy is the seventh teen this month to overdose in L.A. County, including a 15-year-old Bernstein High School girl who died last week. ( City News Service ) L.A. County saw an increase in reports of crimes against street vendors over the summer, although that trend could be partially attributed to an increasing level of comfort on the part of the vendors in reporting the offenses to law enforcement. ( Carter Hyde / Crosstown ) Sheriff Alex Villanueva and retired Long Beach Police Chief Robert Luna engaged in a heated L.A. County Sheriff’s debate, where Villanueva painted his opponent as a soft-on-corruption and puppet candidate, while Luna criticized the sitting sheriff for his controversial raid of county Supervisor Sheila Kuehl’s home.

( Ben Christopher and Sameea Kamal / CalMatters ) 🚨 In case you missed it In an extraordinary move, the state attorney general booted the L.A. County Sheriff’s Department from a politically charged investigation into county Supervisor Sheila Kuehl. Last week, the sheriff’s department carried out an early morning raid of Kuehl’s home as part of a purported investigation into whether Kuehl pushed L.A.

Here are the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. City Hall is at another boiling point. Embattled Councilmember Kevin de León exchanged assault charges with an activist after a physical altercation on Friday as chaotic council meetings continue to be marked by expletive-hurling officials, disruptions from protestors and council member walkouts. Clara Harter / Los Angeles Daily News 2. USC’s sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams won the Heisman Trophy, an award that annually crowns the most outstanding player in college football. Though the Trojans will still have to watch the College Football Playoff from the sidelines, the Heisman capped an otherwise stunning one-season turnaround for the team led by Williams and Head Coach Lincoln Riley. Antonio Morales / The Athletic 3. Karen Bass was sworn in as LA’s first female mayor on Sunday in a ceremony featuring appearances from Vice President Kamala Harris, Stevie Wonder and the poet Amanda Gorman. Bass’ first order as mayor will be to tackle the homelessness crisis that her predecessor Eric Garcetti is largely seen to have failed to address. Julia Wick, Benjamin Oreskes and Dakota Smith / Los Angeles Times 4. Roughly 12,000 of the striking University of California academic workers return to work today, bringing a partial end to the strike as it enters its fifth week. Still, the university system’s teaching assistants remain on the picket line, throwing finals week into chaos even as the UC and labor representatives agreed to private mediation. Shawn Hubler / The New York Times 5. The Port of Los Angeles has lost its crown as the busiest container port in the United States as the supply chain shifts to the East Coast. Fears of a dockworkers strike stemming from still-unresolved labor negotiations are the likely culprit for the shift despite reassurances from labor parties that that won’t happen.

We’ll see you next on Tuesday, when we return from the long weekend. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. The Atlantic Coast Conference voted to add Stanford and Cal to its ranks, cementing the death of the Pac-12 in a new era of conference realignment. SMU will also join the ACC, bringing the conference to 18 schools once the expansion officially begins in the 2024-2025 academic year. Steve Gardner / USA Today 2. USC may have improperly awarded tens of thousands of dollars in federal financial aid to its students during the pandemic, a two-year Department of Education audit found. In some instances, auditors found that USC artificially lowered students’ reported adjusted gross income, qualifying them for more federal aid. In another instance, a USC official classified a student as homeless without proper documentation. Sparsh Sharma / Daily Trojan 3. California regulators green-lit a proposal to increase storage capacity at the Aliso Canyon Natural Gas Facility, where the country’s largest known methane leak occurred in 2015 and forced thousands of Angelenos to move from their homes. Southern California Gas Co., which requested the controversial increase and operates the facility, said the ruling will allow it to store more cheap gas in the summer and fall, lowering prices in the winter months. Robert Jablon and Julie Watson / Associated Press 4. USC graduate student workers rallied Thursday afternoon in support of their nascent union, pushing for more concessions from the university in ongoing negotiations. Already, the workers have won points like six weeks of paid time off and are now targeting harassment and discrimination protections, as well as support for international workers. Benjamin Gamson / Daily Trojan 5. Bioluminescent waves are back in Southern California. Head to Oxnard, Malibu, Laguna Beach and Newport Beach at night for a glimpse of the natural phenomenon, caused by dinoflagellate algae that’s red during the day — but glows blue at night. Researchers say that dinoflagellate, a type of phytoplankton, are able to gather in such high densities because of an exceptional ability to swim. “In the plankton world, they are Michael Phelps,” one scientist said.

It’s Monday, and I’m reading about how Los Angeles is the country’s second-most forgetful city. Onto the five USC, LA and California stories you need to know for today. Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC canceled all outside speakers at this year’s main graduation ceremony, citing the “highly publicized circumstances” of the event. The said circumstances are, of course, the national firestorm that the university set ablaze when it canceled valedictorian Asna Tabassum’s speech at least ostensibly over “safety concerns.” Also: The American Civil Liberties Union said it’s considering representing Tabassum in a free speech lawsuit against USC. This is, truly, the gift that keeps on giving. Stephanie Saul / The New York Times 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] California authorities won’t share the results of a three-year investigation into the scandal-ridden LA Sheriff’s Department that they previously promised to make public. Then-California Attorney General Xavier Becerra initiated the probe in 2021 in response to years of allegations of deputy gang violence, misconduct and deputy shootings. But the report has only been shared in closed-door meetings between state and county officials — not with the public or even the county’s civilian watchdog commission. Cerise Castle / Capital and Main 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] U.S. officials are increasingly distancing themselves from China, a primary geopolitical rival. Not so for California politicians. San Francisco Mayor London Breed just returned from a chummy nine-day visit to the country only a few months after a similar visit by Gov. Gavin Newsom. And, no doubt thanks to their courtship, Chinese officials say they plan to send giant pandas to zoos in San Francisco and San Diego in a move that’s largely seen as a form of soft diplomacy. Jonathan Cheng / The Wall Street Journal 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] If you were hoping for another superbloom this year: Sorry, you’re out of luck. Turns out the extravagant display of wildflowers that famously blanketed California last year is a fairly rare phenomenon. Native wildflowers thrive when long periods of drought precede wet conditions because they don’t have to compete with invasive plant species — which can’t survive the dry stretches. But back-to-back wet winters have allowed invasive grasses to thrive and drown out the colorful cast of wildflowers in the desert. Fiona Ng / LAist 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A devastating but unsurprising USC study raised the possibility that teens who consume high levels of junk food could face long-term memory problems. Researchers found that adolescent rats who were fed a fatty, sugary diet struggled to keep up with a control group when put through memory tests. Switching the test group to a healthier diet later in life yielded no benefits — meaning, the damage is done during adolescence. And I am, personally, done for.

Here are the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Black Lives Matter activists are calling on the LA Police Department to stop responding to minor traffic incidents after the death of Keenan Anderson, who police say died four and a half hours after being tased multiple times. The activists also called for the city to reform its taser use policy. Linh Tat / Los Angeles Daily News 2. The Tulare County Sheriff backtracked after suggesting Monday’s massacre was the work of the drug cartel — but said he hadn’t eliminated the possibility. New details in the murders also came to light, including the fact that a 16-year-old girl and her infant son were shot “execution style” after trying to flee the home. Staff / Los Angeles Times 3. LA Police Chief Michel Moore banned the “Thin Blue Line” flag from station lobbies, patrol cars and uniforms, citing the fact that the flag can be divisive and represent racism. The police union quickly blasted Moore, accusing him of “pandering” while he seeks reappointment. Emily Elena Dugdale / LAist 4. Northern California has seen so much rain in the last three weeks that Abraham Lincoln was president the last time it poured this hard. From Dec. 26 to Jan. 15, San Francisco — used for historical comparisons because the city’s records date back the farthest — saw 17 inches of rain, beaten most recently by “The Great Flood of 1862.” Paul Rogers / The Mercury News 5. A San Francisco city committee called for one-time reparation payments of $5 million to eligible Black residents. To qualify, residents would need to be Black; over 18; born in the city between 1940 and 1996; a resident for at least 13 years; and be someone formerly incarcerated or the direct descendant of someone incarcerated during the war on drugs.

Striking actors reached a tentative deal with Hollywood studios, ending a grueling 118-day strike and portending something of a return to normalcy for an industry hobbled by a pair of strikes for the better part of the last four months. The union’s national board is expected to officially review the contract — which includes pay increases, a “streaming participation bonus” and artificial intelligence regulations — on Friday. Katie Kilkenny / Hollywood Reporter 2. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s approval rating among California voters has dipped to an all-time low of 44%, according to a new UC Berkeley poll. The governor’s biggest loss was among young voters between ages 18 and 29, where he lost 15% approval compared to February. Analysts blamed Newsom’s increasing focus on his national profile for the lackluster ratings, underscoring the tension between the governor’s duties at home and his suspected presidential ambitions. Alec Regimbal / SFGate 3. Dueling protests outside the Museum of Tolerance turned violent Wednesday night while a private screening of a video compilation of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel was underway inside. A small group of demonstrators threw punches and pepper sprayed each other in the parking lot of a nearby gas station, and police detained at least one person. Staff / Los Angeles Times 4. An LA County coroner investigator was charged with grand theft for allegedly stealing valuable items from deceased people whose deaths he was tasked with investigating. Authorities said Adrian Muñoz, 34, was caught stealing a gold crucifix chain from a deceased man on surveillance footage, and that investigators found other potentially stolen items in his cubicle. Muñoz has worked for the LA County Medical Examiner’s Office since 2018. Emily Holshouser / Los Angeles Daily News 5.

Share this with a friend 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] As anxious high school seniors burn prayers in r/USC for today’s admissions decisions, one fact may offer them a glimmer of hope: USC expects to raise its acceptance rate for the first time in years, shirking a habit that saw it reach an all-time low of 9.2% last year. This time around, the number will sit at 10%. Anna Esaki-Smith / Forbes 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Professors are pissed about USC’s budget cuts. The university, one professor argued, is “blanketly” slashing spending while faculty are in the dark with no “real seat at the table.” It’s the “perfect example as to why we need a union,” said professor and union organizer Michael Bodie. Adam Young / Daily Trojan 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Snoop Dogg, who has recently demonstrated a willingness to perform at nearly any event , will deliver this year’s graduation address at the Marshall School of Business. Snoop was most recently at Marshall last year when he was named the school’s Entrepreneur of the Year . Paige Shea / Annenberg Media 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The death penalty is back in LA County , a move long promised by tough-on-crime District Attorney Nathan Hochman. The policy reversal, Hochman said, will only apply in special-circumstance murder cases. But it’s mostly BS: California still has a moratorium on the death penalty, which means nobody, even if sentenced, will actually be executed.

Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A group of Silicon Valley insiders is backing Minnesota Democrat Dean Phillips’ long-shot presidential campaign, launching a novel artificial intelligence chatbot that can answer a delightful range of questions in a voice that sounds like Phillips. The chatbot underscores the fact that generative AI, though relatively benign in this use case, could very well be weaponized against political candidates in the near future. You may notice that today’s newsletter is late, and that’s because I’ve spent 15 minutes this morning trying to get the bot to say something inappropriate. Meryl Kornfield and Elizabeth Dwoskin / The Washington Post 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The drama keeps coming at the LA Times. More than 400 of the paper’s unionized reporters, photographers and editors are walking out today in a one-day work stoppage, protesting imminent mass layoffs that staffers say threaten to gut the newsroom. “This is the Big One,” union leadership wrote. Why should you care? The Times is the largest newspaper in the West and dominates coverage of Southern California. It sets the agenda, exposes wrongdoing and holds elected leaders accountable in one of the most populous metro areas in the country. Katie Kilkenny / The Hollywood Reporter 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] At the height of a dry spell in 2022, California farmers drained the Merced River dry — literally. One downstream gauge reported zero water moving past it for a four-month period. Worse, it took months for state regulators to discover the incident, at which point water restrictions had already eased. Even worse: The farmers were most likely drawing water legally. Experts say the incident, which devastated downstream wildlife, was a result of an antiquated system that protects the rights of long-established growers over the environment during droughts. Raymond Zhong / The New York Times 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] LA City Councilmember Kevin de León criticized the city attorney for donating to his council opponent, questioning whether it amounted to political favoritism. De León and the attorney, Hydee Feldstein Soto, have something of a checkered history. Last fall, de León slammed Feldstein Soto’s decision not to prosecute an activist who he got into a physical altercation with at a Christmas toy giveaway. Since then, de León has repeatedly appealed to Feldstein Soto for legal protection against activists that follow him and his staff around City Hall, calling for his resignation for his role in the 2022 racist tapes scandal. Christopher Cadelago / Politico 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The family of Kristin Smart, a Cal Poly freshman who was murdered in a dorm room nearly 30 years ago, is suing the university for wrongful death and negligence. Smart’s murder has grabbed headlines on-and-off over the years, most recently when her convicted killer was attacked in a prison yard. The suit alleges that the university could’ve prevented Smart’s death if only it hadn’t ignored at least five reports of harassment filed against Smart’s killer, and that it mishandled the investigation into her death.

Expect traffic on Saturday — like, lots of it. Los Angeles Football Club will play for the MLS Cup at the Banc of California Stadium in the early afternoon, followed by an evening kickoff as USC takes on Cal at the Coliseum just across the street. Jack Hallinan / Annenberg Media 2. An L.A. Police Department captain tipped off CBS executives when a woman reported that CBS’ former CEO sexually assaulted her, the New York attorney general’s office concluded in a sweeping report. When the woman reported the harassment to the LAPD in 2017, a captain secretly provided Leslie Moonves — the former CEO — and other CBS executives with status updates on the LAPD’s investigation as well as personal details about the accuser. Meg James and Richard Winton / Los Angeles Times 3. Unexpected storms “decapitated” California’s fire season on the heels of a historic September heat wave. The wet weather might seem unusual, but experts say it’s actually typical for California; the past couple fire seasons have been out of the ordinary. Hannah Hagemann and Jack Lee / San Francisco Chronicle 4. Southern California Gas Co. is searching for alternative sources of revenue as the state works to ban the sale of gas furnaces and water heaters starting in 2030. Unlike other major California utilities that also have electricity businesses, SoCalGas deals only in natural gas. The utility, which serves 21.8 million customers, is exploring repurposing its system to transport green hydrogen, an energy source that doesn’t emit carbon. Katherine Blunt / The Wall Street Journal 5. A new state law bans public and private universities from a practice known as “scholarship displacement,” which is when universities reduce financial aid to students who accept private scholarships. Scholarship displacement can often mean that students who earn outside grants end up with a net-zero gain when universities decrease their initial financial aid packages. Alyssa Story / CalMatters 6. California launched a website that will let victims of sexual assault track the status of their rape kits — forensic exams that can help law enforcement identify perpetrators. The site’s launch is part of an effort to address widespread complaints about a backlog in processing. Mackenzie Mays / Los Angeles Times 7. Animals at the L.A. Zoo are in for a treat. Grocery stores and pumpkin patches across the city are donating unsold pumpkins to the zoo for animals to smash, feed and play with. Amanda Coscarelli / Annenberg Media Nation / world President Joe Biden warned that GOP candidates who refuse to accept the midterm election results will lead the U.S. down a “path of chaos” and put democracy at risk in a primetime address. ( The Washington Post ) CVS and Walgreens, the two largest drugstore companies in the U.S., agreed to pay over $10 billion to resolve opioid-crisis lawsuits despite saying the settlements are not admissions of guilt or wrongdoing. ( The Wall Street Journal ) Elon Musk is expected to fire around half of Twitter’s employees and remove the company’s work-from-anywhere policy on Friday.

Tomo Chien May 06, 2024 p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Good morning. It’s Monday, and here’s the winner of the inaugural “Moron of the Year” competition: p span[style*=\"font-size\"] It wasn’t particularly close. I’ll mail it to her office today. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. Share this with a friend 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC President Carol Folt said she “absolutely” won’t resign over her administration’s response to campus protests — and that “all along the way, we’ve made the right choice.” Incredible. Also: In a late-night operation, USC cleared its second pro-Palestinian encampment. At least 12 student protesters were either suspended or expelled . And some Black professors and women who wear hijabs say they’re facing undue scrutiny at campus security checkpoints: lending further credence to my “ TSA-esque ” characterization. Matt Hamilton and Jaweed Kaleem / Los Angeles Times 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] LA Metro’s bus lines were snarled Friday when hundreds of drivers called in sick to protest rising attacks on bus operators. Passengers have punched, kicked, spit on, stabbed and hijacked drivers in recent headline-grabbing incidents, which led Metro to declare a state of emergency over the violence late last month. Metro officials called the Friday protest an “unsanctioned sick-out” and said it led to delays on about a third of bus lines. Christina Merino / Los Angeles Daily News 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The union that represents campus police officers at University of California schools blamed UCLA higher-ups for the bungled response to violent counterprotests at the school’s pro-Palestinian encampment. The hand-wringing comes as UCLA continues to take heavy flak for allowing violent pro-Israel demonstrators to assault student protesters for hours while police stood by. “UCLA administration owns all the fallout,” a union official said. Staff / City News Service 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] When Ronald Reagan was governor of California, he made a habit of antagonizing student protesters — calling anti-war demonstrations “orgies of destruction” and sending the National Guard to quell them. Compare that to Gavin Newsom, a similarly strapping young governor with White House ambitions. He’s said, well, not much. As California college campuses boil over in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war, the governor has largely maintained radio silence and declined to choose sides: Apparently, he doesn’t think he can afford the political risk. Laurel Rosenhall and Mackenzie Mays / Los Angeles Times 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A man who attacked Dave Chappelle during a 2022 show at the Hollywood Bowl is suing the venue and its security team, alleging he was beaten “ruthlessly” when he stormed the stage and tackled the comedian. Isaiah Lee, the attacker, said he “became upset by the discriminatory nature” of Chappelle’s jokes about LGBTQ and homeless people and “rushed the stage in protest.” Chappelle might have a different take: “I just stomped a n—a backstage,” he said after the incident. “I’ve always wanted to do that.” Althea Legaspi / Rolling Stone"},{"slug":"antisemitic-flyers-gubernatorial-debate-downtown-protest-and-more","title":"Antisemitic flyers, gubernatorial debate, downtown protest and more.","date":1666622772000,"web_exclusive":false,"content":"*|MC_PREVIEW_TEXT|* View this email in your browser Good morning , and welcome to a new era of Morning, Trojan.

And now, here are the USC, L.A. and California stories you need to know for today. (Stick around for The Sports Corner with Chris at the end.) 1. Police reported a spate of antisemitism in L.A. over the weekend, with Beverly Hills authorities investigating a handful of flyers blaming gun control on Jewish people a day after a group draped antisemitic signs over a highway overpass. The latter group directly referred to recent antisemitic remarks from Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West. Stuart A. Thompson / The New York Times 2. Gov. Gavin Newsom and Republican challenger Sen. Brian Dahle sparred in the only scheduled gubernatorial debate over homelessness, abortion, gas prices and climate change. Notably, Dahle attacked Newsom for what many have seen as jockeying for a potential 2024 run at the White House; when asked, Newsom committed to serving all four years of his term as governor if reelected. Joe Fitzgerald Rodriguez / KQED 3. Thousands marched in downtown Los Angeles over the weekend, calling for regime change in Iran and demonstrating solidarity with Mahsa Amini, a young woman who died in custody of the country’s morality police. The march began in Pershing Square and ended at city hall. Matt Hamilton and Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times 4. Pandemic-prompted remote learning put American children behind, and now some adults are having regrets. Test scores across the United States have shown that students suffered from deep learning loss , which has some educators and parents questioning decisions to remain online long after clear evidence emerged that schools weren’t COVID-19 super-spreaders. Bianca Vázquez Toness and Jocelyn Gecker / Associated Press 5. Two women filed lawsuits alleging that their husbands died from negligence at Inland Empire hospitals after doctors prescribed them remdesivir to treat COVID-19 without telling them about the dangerous side effects of the drug. Scott Schwebke / Orange County Register 6. A California judge ruled in favor of a bakery owner who refused to make wedding cakes for a same-sex couple because it violated her Christian beliefs. In the case, the baker’s attorneys argued that her right to free speech and expression trumped the anti-discrimination law that the Department of Fair Housing and Employment alleged she violated in its suit. Associated Press 7. California’s drought is hitting tomato farmers hard — and could drive up grocery store prices. Most of the tomatoes consumed in the U.S. come from California, but the drought, rising fuel prices and climate change are forcing some farmers to consider raising hardier crops that require less irrigation. Chase DiFeliciantonio / San Francisco Chronicle Editor’s note I want to take the time to explain some of the changes you’re seeing in today’s newsletter. The new color palette, typeface and overall feel are meant to better reflect Morning, Trojan’s move to Annenberg Media. Gone are the days of me putting together a cutesy project for fun — we’re in it for the long haul now, and we’re looking to expand. This refreshed look reflects a new level of professionalism. I’d like to thank Allison Huang , a freshman at Iovine and Young, for working with me on this refresh. Allison and I founded a newspaper together in our junior year of high school, and she was the one who managed our visual front there. It was a no-brainer to hire her again. The more substantial change I’d like to address is the new way I’m ordering the stories. In the old format that stuck to the “On Campus,” “In L.A.” and “California” headers, I often found myself struggling to find newsworthy stories every day at each geographic scale — particularly at USC — which meant I would include so-so stories for the sake of filling the section. The strict order also sometimes meant that newsworthy stories in the California section were buried underneath less important articles, just because of the geographic structure. That’s no longer the case. From now on, I’ll be ordering the seven stories in terms of my judgement of their pure newsworthiness to USC students — and if that means there are no USC campus stories that day, then so be it. As always, we’re constantly looking for new ways to grow and evolve; even this refresh will only stick around for as long as we don’t come up with any better ideas. But for now, I’m proud to present the new Morning, Trojan, and I’m proud of what it’s taken to get here. P.S. Got feedback? Just reply to this email! Other things I’m reading On politics: “Free Speech for Me but Not for Thee” ( The Atlantic ). “What if the 2022 Midterm Falls in the Forest but Nobody Hears?” ( The Wall Street Journal ). On business: “Welcome to Your Bland New World“ ( Bloomberg ). “How the Fed Might Manufacture the Next Recession” ( New York Magazine ). On climate: “Goats and Sheep Are Brawling in the Rockies. Blame Glacial Melt” ( WIRED ). Other: “Why Thanksgiving Turkeys Will Cost More This Year” ( The New York Times ). That Bloomberg story on “blands” (brand + bland) is one of the more interesting things I’ve read in a while. It’s about the latest phenomenon of companies with predictable direct-to-consumer models, minimal product lines, and pleasing color palettes — think Quip, Harry’s, AWAY, Warby Parker, Casper, etc. — and how they’re a reaction to the over-branding and hyper-commercialization of older legacy brands. But there’s a fair amount of irony inherent in their missions, and consumers ultimately end up paying a premium for a mediocre product. Good story. The Sports Corner Men’s water polo got back in the win column with a 13-11 victory over Pepperdine on Saturday. USC redshirt freshman Jake Ehrhardt led the match with four goals, and is now 10th on the all-time scoring list (159). The Trojans will host No. 3 Stanford this weekend. Women’s soccer played to a draw in Boulder on Sunday. In the 74th minute, Sophomore midfielder Aaliyah Farmer scored a header off an assist from graduate defender Brandi Peterson. The tie brought the Trojans to a season record of 9-2-3 ahead of the squad’s matchup against Washington on Thursday at home. Women’s volleyball had its seven-match win streak snapped by No. 7 Stanford on Sunday. It was only USC’s second straight-set loss of the season — and frankly, understandably so. The Trojans could only muster a .221 hitting percentage, compared to an other-worldly .605 mark from the Cardinal. On Saturday, Oregon football defeated UCLA 45-30 in a highly-anticipated Pac-12 bout. As a result, OU moved up to No. 8 on the Associated Press poll , the Bruins regressed to No. 12 and USC, on a bye in week eight, now shares the No. 10 spot with Wake Forest. The Trojans are still second in the Pac-12 to the Ducks. In pro sports: New year, same disappointment from the Lakers. LeBron James and Co. dropped their third straight game after a 106-104 loss to the Portland Trailblazers Sunday night. Russell Westbrook, with his team leading by one point with 30 seconds to play, unnecessarily took — and missed — a costly pull-up jumpshot, giving Damien Lillard time and possession to hit a go-ahead 3-pointer. Power Outage: The LA Chargers were routed 37-23 by the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday. Two Chargers, cornerback J.C. Jackson (dislocated knee) and wide receiver Mike Williams (ankle sprain), left the game with injuries. The loss brought the Bolts’ three-game win streak to a halt ahead of its week eight bye. In case you missed it College enrollment nationwide declined for a third consecutive year, dashing hopes of what universities thought might be a post-COVID rebound. But online schools and historically Black colleges and universities defied that trend, instead increasing their enrollment this fall.

Lexi Lonas Cochran / The Hill 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC purchased Hebrew Union College’s 50,000 square-foot campus that sits across the street from the Village. Under the terms of the $34.6 million deal, Hebrew Union will lease back nearly two-thirds of the campus while footing the bill for infrastructure, technology, and natural lighting upgrades. Staff / The Real Deal 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] In case you missed it: USC canned its Office of Inclusion and Diversity, merging its staffers with the university’s existing “Culture Team.” It was the latest move by USC to erase explicit references to DEI programs after Morning, Trojan first reported that the school was quietly scrubbing mentions of diversity initiatives from its websites. Tomo Chien / Morning, Trojan 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The LA Fire Department knew for months before the Palisades fire that more than 1,000 fire hydrants needed repairs — but did not share those inspection records with the city.

Tomo Chien February 14, 2024 p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Good afternoon. We typically only aggregate the news, but when we see a gap in coverage, we fill it. In today’s exclusive explainer, I’m writing about a rightward shift in California politics. Tomoki Chien / College Brief p span[style*=\"font-size\"] It wasn’t shocking when San Francisco’s moderate Democratic mayor said she’d join Republicans calling for rollbacks to Proposition 47 , a controversial ballot measure that eased penalties for some low-level crimes. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] It also wasn’t much of a surprise when Democratic lawmakers joined Republicans calling for significant restrictions on homeless encampments across the state earlier this month. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] But what those two moves signaled might be something larger: Could California Democrats maybe — just maybe — be shifting to the right? A course correction p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Yes, said Dan Schnur, who teaches politics at USC, UC Berkeley and Pepperdine. There has been a shift. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “What we’re seeing now is not necessarily a return to the 1990s, but perhaps just back to the 20-teens,” Schnur said. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] In the summer of 2020, the high-profile killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor turbocharged what had been a steady leftward shift in the national conversation about criminal justice over the past few decades. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] But that might’ve pushed Democrats too far left, Schnur said. Today’s policies are adjusting for that. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “‘Course correction’ is probably the right word to use,” said Bill Lockyer, the former California attorney general. “But I would say it’s a four-degree shift, not an 80-degree shift.” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Lawmakers don’t always get everything right on the first try, and Lockyer said he sees things like proposed rollbacks to Prop. 47 — the 2014 crime measure that the moderate mayors of San Francisco and San Jose want to amend — as fine-tuning of legislation. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Note that although the decade-old measure isn’t a product of the Black Lives Matter movement, it is an obvious target for any lawmaker looking to crack down on crime: Republicans have already mounted a perennial effort to roll it back. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] But today’s rightward tilt could have as much to do with the rhetoric of the Black Lives Matter movement as any particular policy. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “I think there will be studies in the future about the degree to which the phrase ‘defund the police’ contributed to this countershift,” Schnur said. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Defunding the police, a rallying cry during 2020’s massive protests, was never a popular front. It isn’t particularly hard to see how a moderate frustrated with crime today might conflate those far-left cries with criminal justice reform in general. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “‘Defund the police’ was one of the dumbest political slogans ever invented,” Lockyer said. “It wasn’t going to happen — it was kind of a phony issue. And it was a way to label reformers badly and say ‘They just don’t want police, they want anarchy.’” Perception over numbers p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Prop. 47 was intended to reduce overcrowding in state prisons by reclassifying some non-violent property and drug possession crimes as misdemeanors. On that front, it worked , and it likely didn’t contribute to any rise in crime while at it. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Crime statistics are often mixed and sometimes misleading , and it’s not always clear what drives the ebbs and flows. But we do know that crime spiked during the pandemic then leveled off , and San Francisco and Los Angeles have generally gotten safer over the last few years. Notably, though, retail theft went up in 2023, and the state has found itself in the throes of a deadly opioid epidemic . p span[style*=\"font-size\"] But how voters feel about crime often has nothing to do with the actual numbers. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “Voters react very strongly to particular instances,” Schnur said. “The statistics are important to them, but the memory of a specific crime resonates even more deeply.” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] So when footage of smash-and-grab robberies at California retail stores aired day after day on TV last year, voters were watching. Same for when a tech executive was murdered on the street in San Francisco. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Never mind that Prop. 47 only loosens penalties for stealing under $950 — which a lot of the theft on TV was almost certainly above — or that the executive was killed by somebody he knew, not some random criminal. Right now, voters are concerned about drugs and crime, and lawmakers are responding to that. What about homelessness? p span[style*=\"font-size\"] As with crime, the rhetoric doesn’t always match the stats in the homelessness debate. For instance, it’s become something of a cliche to rag on San Francisco when talking about the state’s homelessness crisis, but the city doesn’t even have the largest unhoused population in the state. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] LA, San Jose, Oakland, Sacramento and San Diego beat it out in that order. In fact, San Francisco’s homeless population has actually declined in recent years. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] That’s in contrast to other California cities, where homelessness has gone up . But most of that increase is because of people housed in shelters, not tents out on the street, meaning the increase hasn’t necessarily been visible. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] So Democrats’ recent willingness to ban encampments near schools and parks — and entirely, when there’s shelter space available — might be more a reflection of voter fatigue than any particular spike. Lawmakers are frustrated by the seemingly intractable problem, and the easiest solution is to limit its most visible expression. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “The general public has gone from considerable sympathy for people who are unhoused to significant anger about it,” Lockyer said. “It has kind of owned the present.” Election clarity p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The true extent of any rightward shift will be more obvious after the November elections. Police unions are throwing money at candidates that they hope will oust progressive city councilmembers. Tech millionaires are funding moderate ballot initiatives to fight the leftward swing of the last few years. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] And in one particularly high-profile case, LA County’s progressive district attorney, George Gascón, is facing a slate of moderate candidates who say he’s too soft on crime. He’ll look to avoid the fate of a similarly progressive district attorney who was ousted by San Francisco voters in 2022. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] But in many ways, Gascón’s reelection bid is already telling: The debate centers on the best way to fight crime, rather than how to reform police departments and fight racial disparities as it did when he won in 2020. The mood has clearly shifted.

We’ll send out weekly editions every Friday until then. Happy holidays, and have a great break! And now, here are the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. The National Labor Relations Board will pursue unfair labor practice charges against USC, the Pac-12 and the NCAA. Advocates argue that USC’s athletes are employees of the school and have thus been unlawfully treated. If successful, such a move would classify basketball and football players at any private university as employees and therefore grant them the right to unionize. Dan Murphy / ESPN 2. Californians who install new home solar panels will get at least 75% smaller payments for excess power, the California Public Utilities Commission voted in a controversial overhaul of state rooftop solar regulations. The new rules will instead set aside $900 million in incentives to help residents purchase new panels, two-thirds of which are specifically for low-income households. Julie Cart / CalMatters 3. LA landlords can begin evicting tenants on Feb. 1, bringing an end to one of the city’s major pandemic-era renter protections in place since March 2020. Landlords still won’t be able to raise rent in large swaths of the city until February 2024, though. Liam Dillon / Los Angeles Times 4. The mother of Melanie Ramos, the 15-year-old girl who died of an overdose in a Hollywood high school bathroom in September, sued the LA Unified School District alleging school officials knew its students were using drugs but did nothing. Ramos died after swallowing a Percocet pill likely laced with fentanyl. Thomas Peele / EdSource 5. San Bernardino County will study the possibility of seceding from California to form its own state. The move would have to be approved by the California Legislature and U.S. Congress, a highly unlikely prospect. Still, the discussion in the state’s fifth-most populous county — that’s relatively diverse and adjacent to LA County — underscores deep political divisions in a deep blue state. Michael R. Blood, Jae Hong and Amy Taxin / Associated Press You’re all caught up. Thanks for reading Morning, Trojan, and have a good day.

Check out today’s stories, then have a good long weekend. I’ll see you on Monday! 📍 On campus Hearings begin this week in a wrongful death lawsuit filed against the NCAA by the widow of former USC linebacker Matthew Gee. Gee died in his sleep four years ago at age 49, and was posthumously diagnosed with CTE. In the suit, the Gee family will attempt to prove that football-related head trauma led to Gee’s premature death — but it won’t be an easy case to make. Regardless, the suit could put pressure on the NCAA and university administrators to update concussion protocol. ( Kelsey Dallas / Deseret News ) USC is rolling out a new master’s program in addiction science, a joint venture between the Keck School of Medicine, the Dworak-Peck School of Social Work and the School of Pharmacy. The program starts next fall. ( Grace Harrington / Daily Trojan ) 🌴 In L.A. L.A. City Councilmember Nury Martinez announced Tuesday that she was taking a leave of absence from the council. Earlier this week, Martinez stepped down as president after she was heard making racist remarks and denigrating colleagues in a leaked audio recording that’s since rocked the city. A boisterous crowd filled the council chamber at Tuesday’s meeting, demanding that Martinez and two other council members heard in the recording resign altogether. ( Benjamin Oreskes, David Zahniser, Julia Wick, Dakota Smith and Libor Jany / Los Angeles Times ) President Biden joined the chorus of prominent politicians calling for Martinez and two other council members implicated in the leaked recording to resign. Some of those other leaders include L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti, and both Rep. Karen Bass and Rick Caruso, the two candidates running to replace Garcetti in November. ( Joey Garrison / USA Today ) Separately, Biden is slated to visit L.A. and Orange counties on a two-day trip starting Wednesday. The President will discuss “historic investments in our nation’s infrastructure” in L.A. on Thursday; attend a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee fundraiser later that day; then travel to Orange County on Friday to discuss “lowering costs for American families.” ( Staff report / Los Angeles Daily News ) 🌅 California The Supreme Court is weighing a California animal cruelty law that pork producers say could upend their industry and raise grocery store prices — but the court’s ruling will have implications far beyond just bacon. Californians consume 13% of the pork eaten in the United States, but nearly 100% of it comes from hogs raised outside the state; the heart of the matter is to what extent California can regulate the practices of out-of-state farmers, and what that might mean for interstate commerce more broadly. ( Jessica Gresko / Associated Press ) An overwhelming demand for online classes is reshaping California’s community colleges. In the pre-pandemic fall of 2019, 80% of community college classes were fully in person, 15% were fully remote and 5% were hybrid. Two years later, 25% were in person, 65% remote and 10% hybrid. ( Debbie Truong / Los Angeles Times ) 🚨 In case you missed it San Diego State officials have come under fire after giving conflicting accounts of how the school handled a gang rape allegation. The university leadership has found itself in the hot seat since allegations that a star football player and his teammates gang raped a 17-year-old high school senior at an off-campus party became public months ago.

It’s Monday, and we’re reading about how California is the most biodiverse state in the union. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Mayor Karen Bass wants to add 1,000 officers to the LA Police Department, seeking to reverse the outflow of personnel that’s reduced the department by nearly 10% since 2019. She’s sure to face pushback: The city council’s two newest members both campaigned on reducing the police force, and numerous activist groups are arguing to reallocate police funds to social services. David Zahniser and Libor Jany / Los Angeles Times 2. Federal officials approved a 732-mile transmission line capable of bringing power from Wyoming wind farms to Arizona, Nevada and California. Projects like the transmission line, which will bring enough electricity to power 2 million homes, are increasingly key to the country’s zero-emissions future. But the line’s two-decade permitting process underscores the bureaucratic land mines on the way there. Gabriela Aoun Angueira / Grist 3. Gov. Gavin Newsom is facing mounting pressure to appoint a Black woman to represent California in the Senate — if Sen. Dianne Feinstein is forced to retire early because of her health. Mayor Bass, San Francisco Mayor London Breed and Rep. Barbara Lee, who’s already running for Feinstein’s seat, have all been floated as possible nominees. Lara Korte and Rachel Bluth / Politico 4. California’s three major power companies proposed a new billing system that would charge a fixed rate for basic electricity services based on household income. Southern California Edison estimated that bills would drop by 16%-21% for lower income customers and 33% per kilowatt hour for all residential customers overall. Marc Sternfield / KTLA 5. A bill that would’ve banned all tobacco sales in California quietly died in the Legislature, a perhaps puzzling outcome for a state that three years ago banned flavored tobacco products at the behest of advocacy groups whose end goal is to “create a tobacco-free future.” Some worried that the bill would push tobacco into the black market. Others thought efforts by local cities would be more effective. And yet more don’t want to lose dollars from the lucrative tobacco tax. Alexei Koseff / CalMatters You’re all caught up.

It’s Tuesday, and we’re reading about the best meals in Los Angeles under $15. Onto the five USC, LA and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Mayor Karen Bass said she intends to expand her homelessness program, Inside Safe, by $250 million in her first State of the City speech. The already $1.3 billion program seeks to move homeless people off the streets and into hotel and motel rooms, and has thus far been Bass’ signature effort — though the mayor did signal that she’ll turn attention to other matters like public safety and infrastructure in her speech. Staff / Los Angeles Times 2. Northern California authorities arrested 17 men from two warring gangs allegedly responsible for multiple shootings at Sikh temples and a sword attack at a parade. The Sutter County district attorney said all the men arrested are from the Sikh community, which has a large presence in the region; the county in fact hosts one of the biggest South Asian festivals outside of the Indian subcontinent every year. Adam Beam / Associated Press 3. A federal appeals court struck down the city of Berkeley’s ban on natural gas lines in new buildings. The first-of-its-kind ordinance, intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, had been supported by the Biden administration, environmental advocacy groups and eight states including California. The California Restaurant Association was the staunchest opponent. Bob Egelko / San Francisco Chronicle 4. Two Torrance police officers were charged with voluntary manslaughter in the 2018 killing of DeAndre Mitchell, a 23-year-old Black man. Officer Matthew Concannon and former Officer Anthony Chavez fatally shot Mitchell as he sat in a reportedly stolen car with an air rifle between his legs, sparking large protests and an initial investigation that cleared the officers of wrongdoing. Tony Saavedra / Orange County Register 5. A Newport Beach startup is looking to launch an overnight, first-class passenger train service between LA and San Francisco. The privately funded project by Dreamstar Lines Inc. could establish the first night train on that route since the ‘60s, though the intended 2024 launch date — and whether the train could sell enough tickets in the first place — remains up in the air. Perhaps the biggest question is why the startup isn’t selling flamethrowers yet. Bill Buchanan / SFGATE You’re all caught up. Thanks for reading Morning, Trojan, and have a good day.

I’m pleased to finally share the next big step in the evolution of this newsletter. Morning, Trojan is moving under the umbrella of College Brief , a new nonprofit I’m founding that will replicate this newsletter model at college campuses across California. We’ve already hired writers at UC Irvine and Cal Poly SLO to write Morning, Anteater and Morning, Mustang newsletters. We’re going to keep doing what we’ve always done best: Curating campus, local and state stories in succinct (and well-written) emails you can read in under two minutes. Morning, Trojan has always been about bridging the gap between inconsistent social media news consumption and more traditional news reading habits — and getting college students to engage with campus and regional stories that they might not otherwise read. Our model has been successful at USC thanks to your loyal readership, and we’re excited to bring the same type of content to a wider audience. So what does this mean for you? Well, nothing really. When we return in January, the newsletter will look almost identical — save for the new logos — and I’ll still be the one writing every morning. But I do have an ask. We need to raise $150,000 to expand to our goal of 12 other college campuses over the course of the 2024 calendar year. Most of that money will come from large donors and foundations, but right now, every dollar counts. Have you been enjoying this newsletter? Please consider donating a few tax-deductible dollars to help launch College Brief — and keep Morning, Trojan running come January. You can do so here . Thanks, all, and good luck on your finals. See you in January! An aside: Thank you to Christina Bellantoni, Tess Patton and Nataly Joseph who let me incubate this project at Annenberg Media. You’re all caught up.

It’s Thursday, and I’m looking at more photos and videos of San Diego’s “thousand-year storm” earlier this week. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A California bill could make it physically impossible to drive more than 10 mph over posted speed limits by forcing auto manufacturers to install speed limiters in vehicles. State Sen. Scott Weiner, who proposed the bill, said it’s needed to address rising traffic fatalities and noted that speed factors into a third of traffic deaths nationwide. “We have speed limits, and they exist for a reason,” Weiner said. I’m sure this one’s going to go over well. Probably about as well as the football thing . Ricardo Cano / San Francisco Chronicle 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Authorities are searching for a suspect in a double shooting that occurred just two blocks west of USC yesterday afternoon. Police said they arrived on the scene at Jefferson Boulevard and Budlong Avenue just after 4 p.m. and found a 50-year-old man suffering from a gunshot wound and a second victim who didn’t appear to be conscious or breathing. No further details were available. Paige Austin / Patch 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The city of LA is facing a possible budget shortfall of up to $400 million, a city report found. First on the chopping block? “All non-critical vacant positions,” the report recommended. About 1 in 6 city jobs are already vacant, but such cuts could make that a more permanent reality. Perennial overspending by the LA Police Department and ballooning lawsuit settlements both contributed to the shortfall, but the biggest culprit was tax revenue. Business taxes are down, partially because of the Hollywood strike. Sales taxes are down, partly because of inflation. And transient occupancy taxes are down, likely because of a decline in international tourism. Makenna Sievertson / LAist 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The Biden administration is quietly pressuring the University of California to strike a proposal that would allow students without legal immigration status to work campus jobs. The proposal directly challenges federal law, but proponents say the policy would afford equal opportunities to students and would more or less stand in for the now-defunct Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. If approved, the proposal could tee up an awkward confrontation between UC and the Biden administration, already under fire for immigration policies in an election year. Blake Jones / Politico 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] There are no street addresses in this town. Ask for directions in affluent Carmel-by-the-Sea, and you’ll get something like this: “Brown shingle house with the stop sign and the fire hydrant by the driveway.” It’s a beloved tradition. In fact, at one point, residents threatened to secede from California if it forced them to adopt addresses. But times are changing. Try getting an Amazon or DoorDash order. Then try explaining your situation to the DMV. “The argument is, ‘Oh, we want to keep our place quaint,’” one 76-year-old resident said. “Explain to me how it’s quaint.

I’m still mourning USC’s defensive woes versus Colorado on Saturday. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Watchdog groups said a site owned by Boeing and the federal government is likely leaking carcinogenic “forever chemicals” into the LA River, which many of the region’s farmers draw their water from. Advocates say federal regulators have allowed Boeing to continue polluting despite evidence and pressure to act from environmental groups. “California’s pollution control agencies are not just asleep at the switch but appear to be in a coma,” one advocate said. Tom Perkins / The Guardian 2. Gov. Gavin Newsom will appoint Laphonza Butler, a labor leader and abortion rights advocate, to replace the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein. The appointment fulfills Newsom’s promise to name a Black woman to the Senate and allows the governor to avoid tipping the scales in the hotly contested 2024 race by appointing somebody not already in the competition. Christopher Cadelago / Politico 3. Armenian students and their supporters protested the presence of Turkey’s ambassador to the U.S. at a foreign policy conference at Wallis Annenberg Hall Friday, outraged by a Turkish-supported blockade that’s resulted in dozens of Armenian deaths in the Nagorno-Karabakh region. The demonstrators also accused the ambassador and his government of denying the Armenian genocide of 1915. USC Annenberg stood by its decision to invite Mercan to speak, noting that the school believes free speech is a foundational tenet of a research university. Staff / Annenberg Media 4. A dozen LA County cities sued to halt a controversial zero-bail system that went into effect Sunday, citing a threat to public safety. The new system eliminates cash bail for most people arrested for non-violent crimes, instead allowing them to be released for free with a later court date — an attempt to base bail on the severity of crime rather than a suspect’s ability to pay a fee. It’s unclear whether the 11th-hour suit will halt the policy. Staff / City News Service 5. Gov. Newsom vetoed a bill that would’ve allowed striking workers to collect unemployment pay, a loss for union leaders hoping to ride the momentum of the state’s “hot labor summer.” Business owners, whose payroll taxes fund unemployment benefits in California, had staunchly opposed the bill. Newsom said that “now is not the time” to incur costs, citing an upcoming $302 million interest payment due on a federal loan that the state took out to provide benefits during the pandemic.

Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] An atmospheric river swept through California yesterday, spurring widespread flooding, mudslides and road closures. In Long Beach, which felt some of the strongest effects, streets were submerged in water up to the base of many parked cars’ doors, and officials had to rescue a number of people trapped in their vehicles. Meteorologists say a second, stronger storm system that threatens “life-threatening” flooding could hit the LA area as early as tomorrow night and continue through Monday. Grace Toohey and Ruben Vives / Los Angeles Times 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A 200-person prison riot in Riverside County left eight guards and one inmate with serious injuries. The riot at Ironwood State Prison triggered a statewide prison lockdown, which calls for inmates across the state to be confined to their cells for 24 hours while officials conduct a “threat assessment.” It’s been a turbulent few months for state prisons, including a number of homicides and the sexual assault of a female staffer at one facility earlier this month. Nate Gartrell / The Mercury News 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Caltrans declared a state of emergency over a San Clemente landslide that has indefinitely shuttered Metrolink and Amtrak lines running through Orange County. The declaration will allow the local transit authority to access $10 million in immediate emergency funding to repair the tracks. A Metrolink spokesperson said rail service hasn’t resumed because the slope above the tracks is “still moving,” but that crews were working to brace the hillside ahead of this week’s storms. Officials still haven’t offered a repair timeline. Karen Garcia / Los Angeles Times 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] California will spend at least $2 billion to remedy pandemic-related learning loss as part of a settlement in a lawsuit that accused the state failing its constitutional obligation to provide equal education to lower income, Black and Latino students during the pandemic. Roughly 1 in 5 California students didn’t have sufficient access to online classes, the suit claims. The settlement will call for school districts to identify students who have fallen behind and target them with measures like small-group tutoring and extra learning time on school breaks. Sarah Mervosh / The New York Times 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A Torrance man is at the center of a high-end brothel network that federal authorities are investigating as a potential Korean spy sting. When James Lee, 68, was busted in November for running the East Coast-based sex ring, authorities said the network’s clientele included elected officials, tech executives, military officers and government contractors. Now, they say, the paper trails shows that an “astounding amount of money” went directly to South Korea — and that’s raised potential national security concerns. “This could be a foreign adversary garnering intel on powerful people,” one investigator said.

Around 4,100 students voted this year, which was the first time both the presidential and senate elections adopted a ranked-choice voting system. I think we ought to create a USC that “L.O.F.T.S.” Starts with “lower,” ends with “tuition, stat!” Quinten Seghers / Annenberg Media 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Around 200 anti-Israel protestors at UC Berkeley shut down a guest lecture by an Israeli lawyer, breaking down a door, smashing a window and allegedly roughing up student attendees in the process.

Jon Healey / Los Angeles Times 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A federal judge struck down a California ban on billy clubs and batons, arguing that it unconstitutionally violated the Second Amendment. Such weapons have been banned in the state — with exceptions for law enforcement and some state-licensed security guards — for over a century now. “If people have the right to own and carry a handgun, it makes very little public policy sense that they can’t carry a billy club,” said a lawyer representing two veterans who challenged the ban. Alex Riggins / The San Diego Union-Tribune 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] In 1747, King Ferdinand VI of Spain issued a decree that stated, simply: “California is not an island.” It was an attempt to finally lay to rest a centuries-old cartographical fallacy that California was, in fact, an island separate from the mainland. You can thank a mutineer from Hernan Cortez’s 1533 Mexico expedition for the confusion. When the man stumbled upon the elongated Baja California peninsula, he mistook it for an island and named it “California” after a fictional island of the same name in a popular novel. The fallacy persisted for centuries, sometimes by design — the British discovered Point Reyes, so the Spainards called California an island so they could maintain their claim on the mainland — but mostly by accident.

Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] An ambitious plan to connect LA and San Francisco with a bullet train is at risk of going off the rails. The project, which voters approved in 2008, promises to shuttle riders between the cities in just under three hours for far cheaper than an airline ticket. But 16 years later, the state is still $7 billion short of what it needs to complete an initial segment between Merced and Bakersfield. It’ll take about $100 billion to construct the entire rail line: That’s three times the initial projection. Watchdogs say lawmakers need to decide soon whether to commit to the project or abandon it. Ricardo Cano / San Francisco Chronicle 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A new state law that bans police departments from sharing mugshots of most nonviolent suspects on social media went into effect this year — so one Southern California department got creative. The Murrieta Police Department announced plans to post full-body mugshots but obscure faces with Lego heads, noting that it “prides itself in its transparency” but also “honors everyone’s rights & protections.” Not everyone’s impressed. “The effect is comical, that this is something to mock and take lightly,” a criminology professor said. “It’s part of a long tradition of humiliating and public shaming people who are arrested.” Summer Lin / Los Angeles Times 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Two weeks after the primary election, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s signature mental health initiative still hangs in the balance. Proposition 1 — a sprawling measure that promises to fund housing and treatment for homeless people struggling with mental health and addiction — was supposed to pass easily. But as of yesterday morning, the proposition was only ahead by 20,000 votes with about 220,000 ballots left to count. The race is so close that supporters and opponents have launched efforts to “cure” ballots that weren’t counted because their signatures don’t match the ones on file; they’ll do that by persuading voters to complete a form that lets them appeal the rejection. Shawn Hubler / The New York Times 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Larry H. Parker, the personal injury attorney famous for his braggadocious television ads and cartoon billboards, died at 75. Over the course of his 50-year career, the Southern California lawyer ran an eponymous law firm that says it has recovered more than $2 billion in verdicts and settlements. Parker framed himself as a “real guy” who’d go to bat for everyday people against insurance companies. His approach wasn’t without controversy, though: Legislators and lawyers bristled at his ads, arguing that they encouraged people to rip off the system. “We’re always going to be attacked,” Parker said. “But in the end, in a lifetime, everyone needs a lawyer.” Emmett Lindner / The New York Times 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Dr. Dre finally earned his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in a ceremony yesterday.

Tomo Chien / Morning, Trojan 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Jon M. Chu, the director of “Wicked” and “Crazy Rich Asians,” will deliver this year’s graduation address at the Coliseum. Sound familiar? That’s because Chu was supposed to give last year’s keynote address, until USC managed to fuck it up — a fact that is conspicuously missing from the school’s announcement. Nina Raffio / USC Today 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Police shot at a man who pointed what they thought was a gun at them on Scarff Street between Adams and 23rd Tuesday night. The man, who called 911 to report that he had a handgun and grenade and was suicidal, was not struck by the gunfire and was detained after cops deployed chemical gas. It turns out he had a replica gun. Staff / City News Service 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A new poll suggested that the vast majority of LA County voters support stricter building codes and more funding for fire departments in regions burned by January’s wildfires — even if that means higher taxes. Another finding: Just 1 in 5 residents approved of Mayor Karen Bass’ handling of the crisis. Hunter Clauss / Los Angeles Times 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] It’s time for the annual pilgrimage to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. When surveyed, students said they plan to: Chill. Hang out on boats. Go to concerts. Tan. Hang out on more boats. And tan again. All presumably while in various stages of inebriation. “Everyone here goes to Cabo,” said a student who evidently keeps a close social circle.

Tomo here: Please forgive us for missing Friday’s newsletter. I woke up feeling quite sick. I’m pleased to share that we’re bringing on a new writer, Alia Noll , who will rotate with Salome throughout the week. I’m hoping that expanding our team will mean we miss fewer newsletters. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Sen. Laphonza Butler said she won’t seek a full term next year, ending any speculation that the interim senator would take on the formidable Reps. Katie Porter, Adam Schiff and Barbara Lee in the hotly contested race for the late Dianne Feinstein’s seat. Butler, traditionally a behind-the-scenes power player in labor and fundraising efforts, didn’t say whether she’d seek another public office in the future. Rumors were already underway in Sacramento that she might consider a 2026 run for governor. Melanie Mason / Politico 2. Striking actors and Hollywood studios will resume negotiations on Tuesday, nearly two weeks after management froze talks, saying the two sides were too far apart. The news coincided with the strike’s 100-day mark, making it the longest industry-wide actors strike in recent memory. Internal pressure has been mounting within the actors union, epitomized by an alternative proposal that A-lister George Clooney suggested that indicated that actors are growing restless. Gene Maddaus and Cynthia Littleton / Variety 3. The owner of an unlicensed lab in the Central Valley was arrested Thursday for illegally manufacturing hundreds of thousands of COVID-19, pregnancy and HIV tests. The FDA launched an investigation into Jia Bei Zhu, a Chinese national, after city officials discovered 1,000 white mice in his warehouse — sparking internet conspiracy theories that Zhu was making biological weapons. Zhu has been charged with failing to obtain permits to produce the tests, mislabeling kits and making false statements. Staff / Associated Press 4. People love to drag San Francisco — and maybe rightfully so. A majority of its own residents bash the city in polls for its homelessness and open air drug use, but a new ad campaign is looking to fix that. Funded by the tech billionaire sons of Gap Inc.’s founders, the “It All Starts Here” campaign is promoting the city’s history — cable cars, Levi’s jeans, Harvey Milk, the Summer of Love — on billboards and internet ads. There’s precedent for this: In the 1970s, suffering a similar poor perception, New York City hired the esteemed Milton Glaser to help. He created the iconic “I Love NY” logo. Heather Knight / The New York Times 5. A Bay Area high school football game devolved into an all-out brawl Friday. The game between Vallejo and Kennedy high schools started off well enough until officials were late to blow their whistles on a tackle. Then, both teams cleared the bench and were throwing punches. Then, during a 10-minute delay while officials consulted with the schools’ athletic directors, another skirmish broke out — but this time between the coaches, who ended up strewn on the field. And then, of course, fighting erupted between players and spectators in the bleachers. Thomas Gase / Vallejo Times Herald You’re all caught up.

It’s Thursday, and I hope you saw the ads we posted around campus yesterday. I haven’t gotten any angry emails about them — yet. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] You can buy Plan B for cheap at a new vending machine in the Village. Emergency contraception typically retails for between $10 and $50; the Village machine sells it for $5, thanks to subsidies from the Undergraduate Student Government and USC Student Health. The machine also sells hygiene essentials, medicine and the overdose-reversal drug Narcan. FYI: If you don’t feel like buying Plan B in the middle of the Village in broad daylight, there’s a second machine in the Royal Street parking structure — though it’s under maintenance right now. Staff / Annenberg Media 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Not only does the LA County Sheriff’s Department have a prolific history of generating embarrassing scandals, but those scandals cost money — like, a lot. The department contributed a hefty $150 million to the county’s nearly $1 billion in legal expenses last fiscal year, propelled by the rising cost of hiring outside lawyers and resolving cases that had stalled during the pandemic. One case of note: a combined $48.85 million payout after deputies shared graphic photos of the helicopter crash that killed Kobe Bryant and his daughter. Rebecca Ellis and Keri Blakinger / Los Angeles Times 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Dominic Choi will serve as interim chief of the LA Police Department to fill in for the outgoing Michel Moore, who announced his retirement last month. Choi, a USC alum, will be the first Asian American to lead the department. His role is expected to last around nine months while the city searches for a new leader, and he won’t compete for the permanent role per the terms of accepting the interim job. Choi is an LA native and the son of immigrant Korean parents, and has served on the force for nearly 30 years. Staff / LAist 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Five Marines died in a helicopter crash in the mountains east of San Diego, the Marine Corps said. The Marines were flying from an Air Force base in Nevada to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego on a routine training flight when the helicopter went missing. Search teams found the helicopter yesterday but didn’t confirm the deaths until this morning. The military, which hasn’t released the names of the Marines on board, said it’s investigating what caused the crash. Christine Hauser / The New York Times 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] California lawmakers want to ban homeless encampments near schools, parks and transit stations, arguing that the state’s homelessness policies are “failing and Californians are tired of it.” The bipartisan bill would also ban camping on sidewalks if there’s available shelter space and require officials to issue a 72-hour notice before clearing encampments. Advocates for homeless people say that encampment clearing is traumatizing and dangerous, but they face an uphill battle as lawmakers continue to adopt increasingly aggressive homelessness policies.

Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A nationwide matcha shortage is looming on the horizon, fueled by skyrocketing demand from tea-crazed consumers and heavy tariffs on Japanese imports. But at the student-favorite Café Dulce, management has no plans to jack the price on its signature matcha latte — because the cafe caters to the “student lifestyle.” Liam Ervin / Annenberg Media 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The LA City Attorney declined to file charges against hundreds of protesters arrested last year during pro-Palestinian demonstrations at USC and UCLA, citing insufficient evidence. All 93 protesters arrested at USC are off the hook, though two at UCLA will face misdemeanor charges. Staff / City News Service 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] An under-the-radar coalition of private universities has been strategizing behind closed doors to resist the Trump administration. Though it’s unclear which schools are part of the 10-member group, the coalition represents a potentially more potent form of resistance than the recent slew of open letters . Staff / The Wall Street Journal 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The Trump administration abruptly restored legal status for thousands of international students it tried to boot from the country earlier this month, but warned that they may still face visa revocations once immigration officials overhaul their review system. The walk-back will mean little at USC, which has thus far avoided any reported visa removals. Zach Montague and Hamed Aleaziz / The New York Times 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] You may soon be able to openly drink booze on Santa Monica’s popular Third Street Promenade, thanks to a proposal under consideration by the City Council. If approved, Santa Monica would become the first California city to take advantage of a state bill that permits public drinking in an effort to revitalize downtown areas.

Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. California will fine school districts that ban books on the basis of race and sexual orientation under a bill signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom yesterday that goes into effect immediately. The bill also includes fines for districts that purchase replacement textbooks that don’t align with state anti-discrimination laws. Few other states have passed similar laws that punish book bans with fines; Illinois was the first to do so earlier this year, but in the context of public libraries. Blake Jones / Politico 2. A San Bernardino sheriff’s deputy is under investigation for throwing a 16-year-old, 120-pound girl to the ground, sending her to the hospital with head, back and spine injuries. The sheriff’s department contends that Faith Jeffers, the 16-year-old, reached for the deputy’s pepper ball launcher while he tried to break up a fight at a high school football game. The department also wrote in its report that the deputy “pulled the female away causing her to land on the ground” — a fairly generous take. Brian Rokos / The Press-Enterprise 3. LA County pledged to provide 3,000 more beds for mental health and substance use treatment by the end of 2026, potentially settling a 3-year-old lawsuit with a homeless services advocacy group. A federal judge, who has struck down settlements in the case twice before, will review the new agreement Thursday. Doug Smith / Los Angeles Times 4. A grand jury indicted over a dozen people connected to the Hells Angels biker gang who prosecutors say initiated a vicious and racially motivated attack against three Black men in Ocean Beach in June. One of the victims — who were ages 19, 20 and 21 — was left with a “gaping wound” that exposed his lungs after being beaten up and stabbed in the chest. Another was left unconscious after being punched and kicked all over his body. The 17 defendants pleaded not guilty. David Hernandez / The San Diego Union-Tribune 5. The University of California will offer free online college courses to low-income high school students that can be applied as course credit, much like an Advanced Placement class, in an effort to promote equitable access to higher education. The university system joins the National Education Equity Lab — a nationwide initiative to offer college courses to low-income high schoolers — which includes the likes of Stanford and Howard universities. The program will begin in the winter of 2024. Michael Burke / EdSource You’re all caught up. Thanks for reading Morning, Trojan, and have a good day.

It’s Tuesday, and we hope you’ve gotten a good start to your week. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. An entire San Joaquin Valley city is at risk of flooding over. Historic rainstorms have already left water edging its way up levees protecting the farm town of Corcoran, but officials fear the spring snowmelt could be the final straw that submerges the city of 22,500. The city is in a race against time to raise 15 miles of levee by 4 feet in a matter for weeks — a tall task that’ll require more than 50,000 dump trucks’ worth of dirt. Kurtis Alexander / San Francisco Chronicle 2. USC officially dedicated Allyson Felix Field in a ceremony Monday. The field — formerly Dean Cromwell Field — now bears the name of the most decorated American track athlete in Olympic history. Felix, an LA native, was a professional athlete by the time she attended USC to study elementary education; she made her Olympic debut at the age of 18 in 2004. Staff / Annenberg Media 3. California will stockpile an emergency supply of 2 million misoprostol abortion pills after a Texas federal judge ruled against the authorization of mifepristone, another medication for pregnancy termination. The pills are used together in a common two-pill abortion procedure, which can be substituted with a less effective misoprostol-only procedure. Hannah Wiley and Julia Wick / Los Angeles Times 4. Metrolink and Amtrak train services will be restored next week after months of stabilizing repairs due to shifting ground beneath a seaside track. The restoration will reconnect LA, the Inland Empire and Orange County to San Diego County. The reopening of the tracks was delayed due to heavy rainstorms in recent months. Staff / Associated Press 5. A San Francisco appellate court ruled that “expressive honking” is not protected free speech. The ruling came in the case of an Oceanside woman cited for “unreasonable use of a vehicle horn” after she honked 14 times as she drove past a protest outside a congressman’s home in 2017. The kicker is that the officer didn't show up in traffic court, so the woman could’ve walked free — instead, she filed a civil suit that lead to the ruling.

In case you didn’t know, all USC students are eligible for unlimited free rides on Metro rail and bus lines. You can read more about that here . Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. California lawmakers decriminalized the personal possession of plant-based psychedelics, allowing people over 21 to possess limited amounts starting 2025. The bill, which still needs Gov. Gavin Newsom’s signature, would make California the third state to decriminalize psychedelics — a win for advocates who have long highlighted the medicinal benefits for people like veterans and first responders suffering from PTSD. Joel Umanzor / The San Francisco Standard 2. The Orange Unified School District joined a growing number of districts in California to require that school staff notify parents if their children are transgender — just a day after a judge temporarily blocked a similar policy in Chino Valley. The board member who proposed the policy framed it as protecting transgender youth who have high rates of suicide, and whose parents need to know they’re transgender in order to keep them safe. Angelina Hicks and Hosam Elattar / Voice of OC 3. LA officials are experimenting with “cool pavement,” a type of reflective coating for roadways that minimizes heat absorption and can lower the ambient air temperature by as much as 3.5 degrees on extremely hot days. The city plans to focus its efforts on local streets with high heat and minimal shade; the paint is less effective on high-traffic roadways because tire marks ruin it. Charlotte Kramon / Los Angeles Times 4. California could soon impose an 11% excise tax on all guns and ammunition sales, thanks to a bill that soared through the state Legislature and is now headed to Newsom’s desk. If approved, the proceeds would go toward gun violence prevention and school safety programs. The federal government already imposes a 10% to 11% tax that funds conservation and hunter education. Christine Mai-Duc and Zusha Elinson / The Wall Street Journal 5. A spicy chip that hospitalized three Northern California high schoolers last year is being pulled from shelves after a Massachusetts teen died. The chip — Paqui’s One Chip Challenge, seasoned with the notoriously spicy Carolina Reaper pepper — had previously gone viral in a TikTok challenge where users filmed their reaction to eating the absurdly spicy snack. The teen’s parents blamed the chip for his death, but the official cause is yet to be determined. Megan Fan Munce / San Francisco Chronicle You’re all caught up.

It’s Wednesday, and I’m reading about the Los Angeles food reviews the lawyers wouldn’t OK . Onto the five USC, LA and California stories you need to know for today. Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] California threw $24 billion at its homelessness crisis over the last five years — but didn’t track which programs actually worked. In a scathing report, state auditors said they couldn’t assess the cost-effectiveness of most state homelessness initiatives because nobody tallied how many people the programs actually moved into permanent housing and how much they cost after 2021. Worse: Auditors said San Jose and San Diego couldn’t even produce a full accounting of what they actually spent state homelessness aid on. Marisa Kendall / CalMatters 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A man was shot and killed in broad daylight just south of the Coliseum yesterday. Police said the shooting occurred around 5 p.m. near a street vendor on the corner of Vermont Avenue and Martin Luther King Boulevard, and described the suspect as a man between 18 and 20 wearing a black hat, white shirt and tan or brown pants. The victim died on the scene. Staff / NBC Los Angeles 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] LA County agreed to pay a whopping $25-million settlement to the family of a deaf and autistic man who deputies shot and paralyzed three years ago. Deputies claimed that Isaias Cervantes, who was unarmed, lunged for one of their guns during a home visit before they shot him: a point that Cervantes’s attorney called a “complete fabrication.” But despite the unusually large settlement, the sheriff’s department said its deputies didn’t violate any policies — and said the incident was “traumatic for all involved.” Keri Blakinger / Los Angeles Times 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A California court ruled that a Central Valley Assembly member can run in two elections at once. Republican Vince Fong — who’s the hand-picked successor of former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy — will run for both the U.S. House, which he seems likely to win, and for his uncontested seat in the state Assembly. It’s not clear what’ll happen if he wins both, and California’s secretary of state called the court’s ruling “absurd.” Jeremy B. White / Politico 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Hollywood producers already want to make a film about the $30 million Easter Sunday heist in the San Fernando Valley. The real-life story indeed sounds like a blockbuster movie: A crew of thieves, who likely had insider knowledge, disabled the building’s security cameras and possibly the neighborhood’s internet connection. They breached the roof, roped in and somehow cracked a vault without setting off any alarms. Then they burrowed through a concrete wall and made their getaway. “This one is pure ‘Oceans 11,’” one television writer said.

Here are the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. California communities with high levels of electric car ownership tend to be at least 75% white and Asian, affluent and college-educated — raising serious equity concerns as the state looks to phase out gas cars over the next decade. High upfront vehicle costs and a lack of access to chargers for renters and people in low-income communities may be the biggest barriers to expanding access. Nadia Lopez and Erica Yee / CalMatters 2. The LA Metro is using classical music to drive homeless people away from a downtown train station. The music — and its 83-90 decibel volume in particular — has caused an uproar. Critics argue that the solution does nothing to address the root cause of the problem and liken the tactic to torture; prolonged exposure to music at such a volume can cause hearing damage. Jessica Gelt / Los Angeles Times 3. The Biden administration will send $307 million in federal funding to fix California's aging water infrastructure, further battered by this winter’s rain and snowstorms. Most of the remodeling projects are clustered in the Central, Yuma and Imperial valleys and along the Klamath and Colorado rivers. Lisa M. Krieger / The Mercury News 4. The founder of Cash App, Bob Lee, was stabbed to death in San Francisco Tuesday morning. His murder raised a furor: Pundits were quick to accuse city leadership of a soft-on-crime approach and declared the city “lawless.” But city data shows that while crime is climbing out of historic lows during COVID lockdowns, it’s still lower than it was before the pandemic. There's been no dramatic spike in crime. Noah Baustin / The San Francisco Standard 5. Under the guidance of new head coach Andy Stankiewicz, USC’s baseball team is off to a 17-10-1 start — earning a spot on Baseball America’s Top 25 poll. But attendance at Dedeaux Field has reached new lows. During the 2018 season, the Trojans brought in 599 fans per game compared to the 454 so far this season. In contrast, Auburn University posted numbers as high as 3,313 when the Trojans visited last month. Samuel Spitz / Annenberg Media You’re all caught up.

It’s Tuesday, and I’m reading about how a woman survived rain and freezing temperatures for four nights while stuck in her truck near Mount Baldy. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Shohei Ohtani’s $700 million contract with the Dodgers caught a lot of eyeballs — including some the baseball superstar may come to regret. California’s top fiscal officer on Monday urged Congress to take “immediate and decisive action” to restrict high earners from deferring income, citing Ohtani’s contract. The record-setting 10-year deal allows Ohtani to collect $2 million a year during its term, then the remaining $680 million after 2034: That could let him evade $98 million in state income taxes if he moves elsewhere before the payout. Jordan Parker / San Francisco Chronicle 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A December surge in the avian flu forced California farmers to kill off several million chickens while quarantining their flocks. Experts say the consequences could ripple through the agricultural and food service industries, like when a national surge last year drove up the price of eggs. The winter months, when migrating wild birds pass the virus to farm chickens, are typically the worst months of the flu. Salvador Hernandez / Los Angeles Times 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a tobacco company’s challenge to California’s ban on flavored tobacco products. The ban, which will now remain in place, has taken something of a winding road to get here. Gov. Gavin Newsom signed it into law in 2020, but tobacco companies collected enough signatures to get a veto referendum on the November 2022 ballot — which was soundly rejected by voters. A district, then appellate and now Supreme courts all shut down legal challenges to the ban. Amanda Koprowski / Convenience Store News 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] LA City Councilmember Curren Price pleaded not guilty to corruption charges in a case where he’s accused of grand theft by embezzlement, perjury and conflict of interest — all felonies that could mean up to 10 years in prison. Price, who represents parts of South LA, is accused of collecting $30,000 in medical premiums from the city insurance program for his wife, who he wasn’t married to at the time. He’s also accused of voting to approve projects from developers who were paying his wife for consulting work, and failing to report that connection. Frank Stoltze / LAist 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A Gardena man earned himself 27 years in federal prison for a 2020 crime spree in which he robbed nearly a dozen LA businesses at gunpoint including a 7-Eleven, four donut stores, a dry cleaner and, puzzlingly, a veterinarian’s office. Prosecutors called Justin Washington, 34, “a walking crime spree” in his Monday sentencing. Before the string of robberies, Washington had served a 10-year sentence for armed robbery and possession of a deadly weapon, and murdered a rival gang member just two months after his release.

I’m pleased to share that a new colleague — Claire Qiu — will join me and Anna (my editor) in producing this newsletter starting next week. I picked up a photo internship with USC Athletics, so need to cut some of my hours to stay under the 20-hour maximum for student workers. And now, onto your 10-story weekly roundup; our daily coverage will resume on Monday. 1. California officials ended water restrictions for nearly 7 million residents after yet another atmospheric river drenched the state this week. Still, nixed outdoor watering limits may bring little relief to the 27,000 people who remain under flood evacuation orders and the 144,000 who still don’t have power statewide. John Antczak and Stefanie Dazio / Associated Press 2. Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse last Friday renewed fears that the economy is on the brink of a recession. The run on the bank — which was the 16th largest in the U.S. and was involved in nearly half of the country’s venture capital-backed startups — hearkened back to the 2008 Lehman Brothers collapse and sent destabilizing shockwaves through the banking sector. Jon Hilsenrath and Rachel Wolfe / The Wall Street Journal 3. USC will open a new campus next month in Washington, D.C., further expanding the university’s nationwide footprint. The “Capital Campus” will house a range of East Coast undergraduate and graduate programs in the Dupont Circle neighborhood, less than three miles from the Capitol. Noah Danesh / Daily Trojan 4. The LA Unified School District is bracing for a potential three-day strike starting next Tuesday as labor negotiations reach a breaking point. District officials said schools will shut down if the nearly 65,000 service workers and teachers go on strike, leaving working parents struggling to find child supervision. Kate Sequeira / EdSource 5. Floodwaters burst through a levee and inundated the farmworker community of Pajaro in Monterey County last weekend. Officials blocked access to the town as they scrambled to plug the break before more storms hit the state next week, leaving locals with no place to sleep and without access to documents and belongings in their homes. Staff / The Mercury News 6. A California court ruled that gig companies like Lyft and Doordash can continue classifying their workers as contractors, tossing a labor coalition’s challenge that argued that Proposition 22 — a ballot initiative backed by the gig companies — was unconstitutional. Notably, though, the court invalidated a provision in the measure that would’ve made it harder for the Legislature to pass laws allowing workers to organize. Jeremy B. White / Politico 7. The U.S. Senate confirmed Eric Garcetti, the former mayor of LA, as ambassador to India on Wednesday. The approval — a victory for President Biden, who's a staunch Garcetti ally — brought an end to a two-year saga prolonged by questions over whether Garcetti mishandled sexual harassment allegations in City Hall during his time as mayor. Annie Karni and Shawn Hubler / The New York Times 8. LA Metro riders are abandoning the transit system in growing numbers as crime and drug use soars; some Iines are seeing as little as 30% of pre-pandemic ridership. Train operators described seeing riders openly masturbate in subway cars. Maintenance crews often return from work to find their trucks looted. Robberies, rapes and aggravated assaults soared 24% last year — all renewing debates over the best way to reduce the transit’s crime rate. Rachel Uranga / Los Angeles Times 9. USC men’s basketball fell in the first round of the NCAA tourney Friday to a solid Michigan State, whose defenders effectively shut down Boogie Ellis, the Trojans’ star point guard. My condolences to any of you who had USC advancing in your bracket. The women’s team is playing South Dakota State as we publish this newsletter on Friday evening. Michael Cohen / Fox Sports 10. Yosemite National Park is set to reopen on Saturday, ending a weeks-long closure after heavy winter storms dumped as much as 15 feet of snow over parts of the park late last month. The park, typically open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, is expected to see as much as another 2 feet of snow through next week. Nick Veronin / The San Francisco Standard You’re all caught up.

Here are the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. California approved a plan to make girls flag football an official high school sport across the state, building on a similar decision by the Southern Section of the California Interscholastic Federation late last year. The move adds the nation’s most populous state to a growing roster of states offering flag football. Amy Taxin / Associated Press 2. Experts say lakes Mead and Powell are unlikely to refill in our lifetimes as water use increases with growing populations and rising temperatures dry out the Colorado River. The biggest risk might be Lake Mead hitting “dead pool” level, where the waterline becomes so low that water can’t pass through the Hoover Dam. Rong-Gong Lin II and Ian James / Los Angeles Times 3. Beyoncé has now won more Grammys than any other artist in history after the 65th Grammy Awards in LA on Sunday. Still, the evening’s biggest prizes went to other artists: Bonnie Raitt won song of the year for “Just Like That”; Lizzo took record of the year for “About Damn Time”; and Harry Styles won album of the year for “Harry’s House.” Anastasia Tsioulcas and Hazel Cills / NPR 4. Two weeks after the deadly Monterey Park massacre, authorities are still struggling to piece together 72-year-old Huu Can Tran’s motive — and even how he acquired the firearms he used in the shooting. Details about Tran’s troubled life have slowly trickled out, but most have only led to speculation. Scott Schwebke / The Orange County Register 5. Martin Truex Jr. won an accident-filled NASCAR Clash at the Coliseum this weekend. Austin Dillon and Kyle Busch came in second and third, respectively. NASCAR hasn’t yet confirmed whether the Coliseum will host the Clash again in the future. Nick Charles Currie / Annenberg Media You’re all caught up.

Here are the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. California scrapped a $54 million contract with Walgreens after the pharmacy giant said it won’t distribute abortion pills in 21 states where Republican attorneys general threatened legal action. The contract, due for renewal on May 1, allowed the state to procure specialty prescription drugs used mostly by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Katie Robertson / The New York Times 2. At least 12 have died since snowstorms hit Southern California mountain towns, cutting off roadways and leaving some residents trapped in their homes. In one instance, residents said they suspected an elderly neighbor froze to death in her home. Officials said 95% of San Bernardino County roads were cleared as of Wednesday morning, though some were only wide enough to allow for single-lane traffic. Grace Toohey and Summer Lin / Los Angeles Times 3. The storm that’s expected to drench Northern California starting Thursday will largely spare the south, bringing about an inch of rainfall. Snow is possible at over 7,000 feet in elevation and officials warned of “non-life threatening flooding” in the lowlands. Some residents whose homes were already damaged by the severe mountain snow fretted that this storm’s water damage could be the “straw that broke the camel’s back.” Emily Holshouser / Los Angeles Daily News 4. A famed UC Berkeley professor for decades used bones stolen from Native American gravesites to teach anthropology classes — just one part of the university’s long history of excavating burial sites to add to its collections. Berkeley to this day holds the remains of some 9,000 Indigenous people, and the professor, Tim White, has been a particularly strong critic of efforts to return those bones. Mary Hudetz and Graham Lee Brewer / ProPublica and NBC News 5. California’s LA to San Francisco high-speed rail project is stalling. A new report found that the project needs another $10 billion just to connect Bakersfield to Merced — bad timing considering the state’s over $22.5 billion deficit and as the U.S. House’s Republican majority seems unlikely to lend federal aid. Still, though, the dream has a certain allure: 500 miles of rail connecting the north to south in under three hours. Eliyahu Kamisher / The Mercury News You’re all caught up.

Tomo here: Apologies for missing yesterday’s newsletter. I had just gotten back from a wild Big Sur backpacking trip where we got lost, cut up in the coastal brush and had to ration our water… then my girlfriend got bitten by a rattlesnake. We both ended up in the hospital (for different things), and I needed a day of rest. Luckily, I’m pleased to share that we’ve hired a new writer, Salome Nebiyu , who will join me most mornings — and who can take over in the event of another one of my outdoor epics. Our previous co-writer, Claire Qiu, is departing to pursue other work opportunities. We’re very grateful for all her hard work. And now, onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. A study predicted that California could lose as much as 75% of its beaches by the end of the century, thanks to sea level rise and other climate change phenomena. In one Southern California city, that’s already a reality: Only a third of Oceanside’s 3.7-mile coast still has enough sand for visitors to enjoy. City leaders are in a pinch. Do they truck in sand, like Santa Monica did? Build a jetty to combat erosion like Ventura? Or, perhaps, build an artificial reef? Jill Cowan / The New York Times 2. As temperatures sweltered to 102 degrees last week in downtown LA, only three of the city’s four cooling stations on Skid Row were up and running. City officials blamed the delay on a contracting miscommunication with the nonprofit that operates the stations, which provide shade, chilled water and medical supplies to unhoused Angelenos. “If someone wanted to get a Ph.D. in how not to do something at City Hall, here’s your case study,” one advocate said. Nick Gerda / LAist 3. Former President Donald Trump is now favored to win all of California’s delegates at next year’s Republican convention, a boon that could propel him to his third presidential nomination. It wasn’t always this way: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis had previously led in the state, but is now underperforming in polls nationwide. In fact, a pro-DeSantis super PAC said it would suspend major operations in California. Seema Mehta / Los Angeles Times 4. West Coast dockworkers ratified a six-year contract that’s expected to ease tensions and re-divert shipments to the ports of LA and Long Beach — traditionally the nation’s busiest ports, which lost as much as a quarter of their traffic to the East Coast last year in the heat of contract negotiations. The new contract covers 22,000 dockworkers who work in 29 ports stretching from LA to Seattle. Kurtis Lee / The New York Times 5. A contentious bill that bans caste-based discrimination passed the state Legislature and is now headed to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk. The bill, a bid to protect against discrimination within South Asian communities and promote fairness in employment and housing, prompted hours of comments at a public hearing this summer with lines extending out of the State Capitol. Critics contend the bill could force South Asians “to answer intrusive questions” and is unfair because it only applies to people in the caste-based system.

We’re reading about how thousands of octopuses are converging off of California’s coast. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. A new study found that the waves along California’s coast have gotten significantly bigger since the 1970s, a phenomenon fueled by climate change that could lead to worsening coastline erosion. The study’s authors analyzed 90 years of seismic records — the same ones used to measure earthquakes — which can detect when two waves moving in opposite directions collide. Livia Albeck-Ripka / The New York Times 2. A two-story commercial building in downtown LA’s Fashion District caught fire early Wednesday morning, sending a plume of smoke into the air for miles. At the time of sending this newsletter, firefighters were still battling the blaze and no injures were reported. Los Angeles Street between 11th and 12th is shut down. Génesis Miranda Miramontes / NBC Los Angeles 3. For years, a mysterious company bought up thousands of acres in rural Solano County for prices well above market rate. Theories abounded. A massive wind farm? A new Disneyland? A Chinese conspiracy? Turns out some of the biggest venture capitalists and CEOs in Silicon Valley want to build a new city: their solution to the state’s homelessness and housing woes. Experts say it’ll take decades before the project breaks ground. Conor Dougherty and Shawn Hubler / The New York Times 4. West Nile virus infections are on the rise after a particularly wet California winter bore ideal conditions for mosquito reproduction. The state reported 55 total cases this year on Aug. 25, double what was reported in 2022 at the same time. Five of this year’s cases have been fatal. Summer Lin / Los Angeles Times 5. Northern California’s electric utility said it may shut down power for thousands of customers in the Sacramento Valley after officials posted a fire danger warning. It would be the utility’s first shutoff since 2021, when it cut power to nearly 2 million customers in the Bay Area and drew fierce criticism. The issue of shutoffs has become central in the Lahaina fire, where Maui County claims the island’s utility negligently failed to cut power despite fire conditions. Olga R.

Send them here ! 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] In case you forgot: You attend the most expensive college in California. But what you might not know is that since 2019, other schools have jacked their prices at a faster rate than USC. Take Loyola Marymount University, whose housing and meal costs have soared by 56%. The San Francisco Chronicle put together a nifty data visualization. Nami Sumida / San Francisco Chronicle 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Health officials said to stay out of the water at a handful of popular LA beaches that are seeing high levels of ocean bacteria. The no-go waters include the popular Santa Monica Pier and Topanga Canyon Beach. Travis Schlepp / KTLA 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Century City has become LA’s hot new commercial district, housing flashy Hollywood talent managers and high-powered private wealth offices. It’s a far cry from downtown LA just 10 miles to the east, where nearly a third of offices are empty as real estate companies flee what they see as a derelict district. John Gittelsohn / Bloomberg 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC is renting private jets to shuttle athletes across the country now that it has joined the largely Midwest-based Big Ten athletic conference. It’s a time-saving measure meant to alleviate concerns that athletes will be stretched thin by the increased travel — as some teams face flying as many as triple the miles they did in the Pac-12. Luca Evans / The Orange County Register 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The lead singer of a hardcore metal band went on a crime spree for the ages in Yosemite when he assaulted a restaurant staffer, stole a bike, brandished a knife in a luxury lodge, stripped to his underwear, tried to kidnap a store manager, then rammed into a Tesla with a stolen car. His band has released titles such as “God Hates Cops” and “Baptized in Piss and Shit.” Aidin Vaziri / San Francisco Chronicle"},{"slug":"california-scientists-strike","title":"California scientists strike","date":1700150449000,"web_exclusive":false,"content":"*|MC_PREVIEW_TEXT|* View this email in your browser By Tomoki Chien Good morning. It’s Thursday, and I’m reading about how a San Francisco-based cannabis company is collaborating with some of the best chefs in the world to create premium edibles . Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Thousands of scientists working for the state of California went on a three-day strike, seeking to earn comparable pay to their counterparts in local, federal and other parts of state government. The scientists — who regulate pesticides, manage oil spills, study wildlife and protect water supplies — noted that they earn 27% less than engineers employed by the state, even though they both require specialized expertise and education. Rachel Becker / CalMatters 2. USC professors who donate to political campaigns overwhelmingly favor Democratic candidates and policies, according to Federal Election Commission data. From the beginning of this year through the end of August, 99% of all money that USC professors donated — $80,142 — went to Democratic candidates or PACs. Just $841 went to Republican counterparts. Michael Gribbon / Annenberg Media 3. LA officials said they plan to build more electric vehicle charging stations and offer higher rebates to low-income residents looking to purchase battery-powered cars — an effort to expand access to the technology. Qualified residents can receive up to $4,000 to buy used electric vehicles, up from $2,500 under previous policies. “In order to reach a 100% clean energy transition you really need to bring everyone along,” one expert said. Ivan Penn / The New York Times 4. Crews working to repair the Highway 1 after extensive damage wrought by last winter’s storms had hoped to finish by the rainy season: no such luck. A mile-long stretch in remote Big Sur is still buried under 500,000 cubic yards of debris, causing a headache for residents and visitors traveling along the region’s only arterial road. The coming wet winter weather and continued landslides have only further slowed the already crawling pace of repairs. Andrew Pridgen / SFGate 5. Chinese President Xi Jinping indicated that China might send new pandas to the United States after recalling its bears from the National Zoo earlier this month. He appeared to suggest the next pair could come to California, likely at the San Diego Zoo. Xi called the bears “envoys of friendship between the Chinese and American peoples.” Didi Tang / Associated Press You’re all caught up. Thanks for reading Morning, Trojan, and have a good day.

Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. California is suing Big Oil companies for allegedly perpetrating and hiding the negative effects of climate change. The state alleges that Chevron, Shell, BP, Exxon, ConocoPhillips and the American Petroleum Institute have knowingly hid the negative effects of fossil fuels in California, making the companies financially liable for natural disasters accelerated by climate change. Fiona Ng and Ashley Rusch / LAist 2. Officials detained a person of interest in the brazen killing of an LA County deputy Saturday evening in the desert community of Palmdale. Police said security footage showed a car pull up next to Deputy Ryan Clinkunbroomer at a red light, pause, then speed away. Clinkunbroomer, who was shot in the head during those few seconds, succumbed to his injuries in a hospital. Richard Winton / Los Angeles Times 3. A new California law will force about 5,000 large companies to publicly disclose their direct and indirect carbon emissions. The law is the first of its kind in the country and will go into effect in 2027. It’ll apply to businesses with over $1 billion in annual revenue. Coral Davenport / The New York Times 4. The LA Police Department detained two people at USC Saturday afternoon in connection to an armed carjacking at 32nd Street and Shrine Place. Footage circulating on social media showed police running through campus with their weapons drawn. Police are still investigating the incident. Christina Chkarboul / Daily Trojan 5. A small group of California lawmakers is trying to convince Attorney General Rob Bonta to remove former President Donald Trump from the state’s March primary ballot — citing the 14th Amendment, which prohibits public officials who have been party to an insurrection from holding public office again. It’s a novel approach for a long-shot effort, but could provide a model for Democrats in other states looking to do the same. Dustin Gardiner / Politico You’re all caught up.

It’s Friday, and we’re reading about how California’s next superbloom is expected to be visible from space . Here are the five (other) USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. California is bound by federal law to continue doing business with Walgreens through its Medicaid program, despite Gov. Gavin Newsom’s headline-grabbing tweets last month in which he said the state would cease its contracts with the pharmacy giant because it won’t distribute abortion pills in states that threatened legal action. “Tweeting is not policy,” a Newsom spokesperson said. Samantha Young / Kaiser Health News 2. The city of LA sued a local journalist and activist group over the online publication of pictures of undercover police officers. Attorneys for the city said the release of the images — part of a public records request — was inadvertent, and endangered its officers. But media and press rights experts have said the suit holds little legal merit. Staff / Los Angeles Times 3. Experts say an antibiotic-resistant bacteria found for the first time in LA County poses great health risks, especially for immunocompromised people. The bacteria contains a gene that colistin, a “last resort” antibiotic used for serious infections that cannot be treated with penicillin, has proved ineffective against. Vivian Chow / KTLA 4. Marijuana burglaries and thefts more than doubled in California counties between 2021 and 2022, LA County being the hardest hit. Dispensary owners say that 70% of cannabis businesses are unbanked — bigger banks often don’t want to work with dispensaries — effectively putting a target on the backs of the cash-only storefronts. Liz Lindqwister / The San Francisco Standard 5. Rapper Denzel Curry will headline Friday night’s Springfest Concert at USC. The South Florida native is most famous for his 2015 song “Ultimate,” the soundtrack of the bottle flipping craze; we’re glad that one’s over. The concert will also feature a slate of student performers as well as Toro y Moi and Devon Again. Staff / Annenberg Radio News You’re all caught up.

We assume it’s a system-wide Mailchimp bug because it’s affecting even old newsletters that we’re resending to ourselves. So bear with us. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. California is looking to crack down on widespread corruption in the marijuana industry, where, in some cases, local officials have demanded six-figure bribes to approve licenses. The audit, which has the green light from the state Legislature, could help lawmakers draft new regulations that would reform the licensing process. Adam Elmahrek / Los Angeles Times 2. State lawmakers will vote on Gov. Gavin Newsom’s proposed possible penalties on oil companies who gouge prices at the pump Thursday. The effort — which Newsom had originally wanted to be a hard cap on the profit companies can make per gallon — would instead allow the California Energy Commission to decide whether to impose a penalty, and what that penalty should be. Adam Beam / Associated Press 3. Mayor Karen Bass agreed to join talks between the LA Unified School District and union leadership. Thursday is the third and final day of the strike, which the union characterized as a protest of unfair labor practices rather than being a protracted effort to sign favorable terms. The union, however, did leave open the possibility of such a strike in the future. Staff / Los Angeles Times 4. A rare tornado struck Montebello Wednesday morning, damaging 17 buildings and injuring one person. The twister traveled four-tenths of a mile, was around 50 yards wide and was on the ground for two to three minutes. It was only the sixth tornado recorded in LA County since 2005, though there was a weak one in La Mirada last month. Staff / KTLA 5. Residents of the flooded Monterey County town of Pajaro remain locked out of their community without any of the aid Gov. Newsom promised two weeks ago. In a heated town hall meeting, county officials wouldn’t commit to a date residents would be allowed back in the inundated agricultural town, leaving many to continue sleeping in cars and tool sheds without their belongings.

Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] California will remain drought-free through at least 2025, meteorologists say. Thank two back-to-back blockbuster winters that have filled reservoirs well above their historic averages, and, most recently, dumped over 8 feet of snow in the Sierra Nevada. It’s a remarkable turnaround for a state that’s spent much of the last two decades in an on-and-off drought, but experts warned officials not to ease conservation efforts: Drought will return, it’s just a question of when. “In California, water is as precious of a commodity as gold,” one meteorologist said. Brian Lada / AccuWeather 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] In the run-up to the hottest California Senate election in recent memory: Katie Porter campaigned out of her beat-up minivan. Adam Schiff rented a private jet to cover more ground. And Barbara Lee hit events across Southern California. Steve Garvey was nowhere to be seen. The Republican, though, is actually polling ahead of his Democratic challengers — a fitting development for the former baseball star turned political novice who’s managed to run a campaign without any substantive policy proposals or, erm, running much of a campaign at all. Voting today? Here’s a last-minute guide . Staff / Los Angeles Times 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A San Diego man is the first person in the U.S. to be charged with smuggling greenhouse gasses under a novel law. Michael Hart, 58, allegedly bought refrigerants in Mexico then smuggled them across the border to sell for profit on Facebook Marketplace and OfferUp. Those refrigerants contained hydrofluorocarbons — a potent greenhouse gas used in refrigerators and air conditioners — which are in most cases illegal to import into the country as regulators look to phase out the “super pollutant” that can be thousands of times more powerful than carbon dioxide. Rebecca Falconer / Axios 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] For years, investment firms poured money into California almond farms, fueling a boom of the lucrative crop that now covers a fifth of the state’s irrigated farm land. But now the industry’s in a nosedive. Prices for premium almonds have dropped from $4 a pound to less than $2. One of the largest almond conglomerates declared bankruptcy. And investors are saddled with debt. Not everybody is upset, though: Environmentalists have long railed against the notoriously thirsty crop, arguing that almond farming exacerbates an already dire groundwater shortage. “It’s possible that we have hit peak almond,” said one policy expert. Ian James / Los Angeles Times 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A USC geneticist was named one of Time magazine’s “Women of the Year” for discovering a hormone produced by fetuses that triggers nausea and vomiting in pregnant women — otherwise known as morning sickness. Two decades ago, Dr. Marlena Fejzo experienced an extreme and dangerous version of that called hyperemesis gravidarum, which can cause dehydration, weight loss and electrolyte imbalances. But her doctors didn’t believe her. They said it was a bid for sympathy from her husband. Or a way to get attention from her parents. At 15 weeks, she lost the pregnancy. So she made it her life’s work to find the cause of her condition. “Hyperemesis is not the only condition that’s under-researched,” Fejzo said. “We just need more women scientists out there.” Leigh Hopper / USC Today List a party in the newsletter"},{"slug":"california-wraps-up-legislative-session","title":"California wraps up legislative session","date":1694790292000,"web_exclusive":false,"content":"*|MC_PREVIEW_TEXT|* View this email in your browser By Tomoki Chien and Salome Nebiyu Good morning, it’s Friday, and we’re reading about the best free campgrounds in Southern California. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. California lawmakers passed a host of new bills in yesterday’s final legislative session of the year that are now headed to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk. Some of the most important include ones that would allow striking workers to collect unemployment benefits; raise the minimum wage for healthcare workers to $25; mandate lead testing at school fountains and faucets; ban hidden fees on concert tickets and hotel rooms; and require public universities to prominently display the cost of course materials. Lynn La / CalMatters 2. Thousands of federal wildland firefighters could soon see pay cuts of up to 50% as lawmakers in Washington balk at the idea of continued raises for the workers. Already, one in five firefighters employed by the Forest Service in California have quit since 2019. Cal Fire, the state’s agency — which pays more than the Forest Service — has seen modest gains that somewhat offset federal losses. But the two agencies often have different responsibilities, meaning new state firefighters aren’t a complete substitute. Kurtis Alexander / San Francisco Chronicle 3. USC will offer flu vaccine shots for students and faculty at on-campus pop-ups over the next two months. The shots are free for students on USC’s health insurance plan, but cost $20 — billed to student accounts — for those covered elsewhere. Pop-ups will open Tuesdays from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the Village and Wednesdays at the same time at the farmers market. Various schools will also host one-off pop-ups through October. Katie Simons and Jude Ocañas / Annenberg Media 4. Hollywood studios and striking screenwriters could resume contract negotiations next week, which would be the first meeting between the parties in almost a month. The return to bargaining could be a turning point for the 137-day strike, already one of the longest in the history of the Writers Guild. Brooks Barnes / The New York Times 5. Sketchers opened a restaurant at its Gardena store — and it’s been a hit. The concession stand, which serves “Costco-style” food that’s supposedly tastier for a slightly higher price, has quickly earned the attention of food bloggers and influencers and serves more than 2,000 people a week. “It’s not some place you take your wife or girlfriend for dinner, but if you’re looking for a quick bite, in and out, it’s perfect,” one patron said.

In other news: The 93 protesters arrested yesterday will face trespassing charges in court next month. Many professors are pissed . Protesters vowed to continue their demonstrations on campus.

At UCLA, counter-protesters violently clashed with students in a pro-Palestinian encampment. UC Santa Barbara students peacefully occupied a building for the day. A UC Berkeley encampment is wearing into its fifth day. Stanford students erected an encampment for the school’s admit weekend. And at Cal Poly Humboldt, university administrators are trying to reason with a group of students still barricaded in a building.

In an extreme incident this week, a man was arrested for fatally slitting the throat of a 66-year-old woman. “These incidents have occurred with no prompting or warning and have created an environment of increased risk and trauma,” officials wrote. Rachel Uranga / Los Angeles Times 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Former Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein’s overturned rape conviction in New York has raised the possibility that a court will also overturn his LA conviction. Weinstein’s attorney, who called the New York ruling a “great day for America,” argued that the New York conviction “interfered with his presumption of innocence in a significant way in California.” Legal experts largely agree that the LA ruling is likely to remain untouched, thanks to more permissive laws around acceptable evidence in California. Dani Anguiano / The Guardian 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC’s star quarterback Caleb Williams was drafted first overall by the Chicago Bears last night. Williams, the recipient of the prestigious Heisman Trophy, has been labeled a generational talent and a potentially franchise-defining quarterback.

Everybody’s still pissed , though. Folt remained mum when asked why legions of LAPD officers mobilized then inexplicably vanished over the weekend, but indicated that she might be willing to talk to journalists in the future. “I appreciate you asking, and I actually feel that it’s really important that I’m able to talk to you,” Folt told a student journalist. Aw. I’m feeling all fuzzy inside. Mohammed Zain Shafi Khan and Tamara Almoayed / Annenberg Media 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Encampments continue to spread across California college campuses. San Francisco State, Sonoma State, Sacramento State, UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara, UC Riverside, Occidental and the Claremont Colleges are among the latest to join a growing movement that’s led to hundreds of arrests nationwide. None have been nearly as testy as demonstrations at Cal Poly Humboldt and UCLA , though, and no university administrators are yet to garner as much universal hatred as USC’s. A growing chorus of Jewish students say they find the protests “ terrifying. ” Jessica Flores / San Francisco Chronicle 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] California will supply universities and first responders with free Narcan, an opioid overdose reversal drug. The effort is part of CalRx, a state initiative that partners with generic drugmakers to buy low-cost versions of medications like insulin in an attempt to reduce shortages and prod name-brand drug makers to lower their prices. The announcement comes on the heels of a recent high-profile fentanyl overdose of a UC Berkeley freshman. Summer Lin / Los Angeles Times 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] It just got easier to own an electric vehicle in California. That’s thanks to the fact that Tesla, which operates a behemoth network of EV chargers, said it’ll open its stations to non-Tesla vehicles across the state.

Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC President Carol Folt personally decided to bar this year’s valedictorian from speaking at graduation, a USC official said, meaning she’s responsible for what may be one of the university’s biggest PR blunders of all time. Other developments: USC doubled down on its claim that it canceled the speech because it received threats over the valedictorian’s online pro-Palestinian — or, as critics say, antisemitic — rhetoric. But it’s yet to share details. The valedictorian, Asna Tabassum, said she hadn’t even written her speech before it was abruptly canceled. Every major national news outlet picked up the story.

Gavin Newsom said the pro-Palestinian protestors who blocked the Golden Gate Bridge on Monday need to be “held to account” as local prosecutors weigh whether to charge the 38 people arrested by authorities. Demonstrators locked themselves to parked cars, making for a multi-hour protest that trapped motorists on the way to work, school and doctor’s appointments.

(Gage Skidmore) p span[style*=\"font-size\"] This is a guest essay. Dakota Driemeyer is a USC junior, newly elected student government senator, and member of the university’s Turning Point USA Chapter and USC College Republicans. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “Go fuck yourself!” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Those were the exact words spoken to me at a student government forum last month when a fellow senatorial candidate found out I voted for President Donald Trump. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Instead of civil debate, I was met with hatred and an outright dismissal of my deep-held, conservative beliefs. Events of hatred like this do not exist in a vacuum at USC. This isn’t just about one insult — it’s about a culture that treats conservative beliefs as dangerous rather than debatable. At a time when all hope seems lost for genuine and productive political conversations, we need them now more than ever. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Given the need for more conversations like these, the Turning Point USA chapter here at USC worked diligently to bring conservative commentator Charlie Kirk to campus. Today at noon , he’ll set up near Tommy Trojan to debate students, faculty, and other community members about a wide range of our country’s most hot-button issues. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] For many left-leaning Trojans, this has sparked outrage. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] But Kirk demonstrates something we desperately need more of in our political discourse: a willingness to listen to the opposition. Yes, in his most viral clips, Kirk can appear bombastic. But so do his rhetorical opponents. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] If you can spare five minutes, watch the beginning of this viral Jubilee video in which Kirk debates 25 progressive college students. He makes common-sense points delivered in lucid, rational arguments. All are representative of how a substantial portion of our country feels, which the progressive left seems to forget. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Then consider that it is a college student, not Kirk, who assails their opponent’s physical appearance. (“Ugh, his smile is creepy” one student says in an unprompted tangent while debating abortion.) p span[style*=\"font-size\"] In social media posts, students have been up in arms about Kirk’s visit, some going as far as to suggest throwing tomatoes at him. Those posts may be tongue-in-cheek. But I’d urge any student who agrees with the sentiment to consider the fact that we live in a country founded on tenets of free speech and open discourse. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Are we really going to squander those ideals because we’re afraid of a debate? Members of the left have sought to silence conservative voices on issues like the tragedy that is abortion or the attack on religious freedom. I cannot stomach that. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] As a kid growing up in deep-red rural Illinois, I was always told we have more in common than we do different. We must focus on our commonalities and hear each other out. Because at the end of the day, we are all Americans. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] So I encourage you, whether progressive or conservative, to ask Kirk a question today. You might learn something about the conservative movement. Maybe, just maybe, he’ll learn something too. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Morning, Trojan is committed to publishing a range of diverse opinions. Have something to say?

His sizable internet following — and fealty to Donald Trump — have earned him a spot in the president’s inner circle. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Like most provocateurs of his genre, Kirk can espouse commonsense views , and his remarks are often taken out of context . p span[style*=\"font-size\"] But he is also a prolific peddler of outright bullshit famous for inflammatory remarks about race-related issues and false claims of election fraud. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The first event of Kirk’s 2025 tour kicks off Thursday at the University of Florida. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Online tickets , which are free, list the USC event’s start time as 12 p.m. They do not say where the event will be held, though Kirk’s debate-style videos are often filmed outside. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Turning Point USA’s website pledges to release “more information” before the event starts. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Tomo Chien can be reached at tomo@morningtrojan.com ."},{"slug":"chipotle-to-hike-menu-prices","title":"Chipotle to hike menu prices","date":1699024244000,"web_exclusive":false,"content":"*|MC_PREVIEW_TEXT|* View this email in your browser By Tomoki Chien and Salome Nebiyu Good morning.

Content warning: Today’s newsletter contains mentions of sexual assault and rape. 1. Chipotle said it plans to hike menu prices in its California stores to offset rising labor costs, a direct response to the state’s new $20 minimum wage for fast food workers that’ll take effect in April. The Newport Beach-based company said it doesn’t plan to pull additional levers, like opening fewer stores than planned, unless customers react adversely to the price bump. Company executives say the increase will be relatively modest. Jennifer Williams-Alvarez / The Wall Street Journal 2. USC students say an alleged rape in a Lyft ride earlier this week has put them on edge, and that they no longer trust the rideshare platform the university partners with to offer free services. Police still haven’t arrested the driver who allegedly assaulted a female student at the end of a ride early Wednesday morning, and Lyft said it couldn’t confirm that the driver was one of its own. “I’ll never go out in a Lyft by myself again,” one student said. Nick Virnich and Aidan Williams / Annenberg Media 3. California labor officials are investigating an incident on a Santa Barbara farm where a worker was reportedly struck and killed by a truck — then other laborers, including her own daughter, were ordered to keep working while her dead body lay in the carrot field. Grimmway Farms claimed that an internal review didn’t indicate people were instructed to continue working after the September accident. “They don’t care about us for nothing,” one worker who witnessed the incident said. Salvador Hernandez / Los Angeles Times 4. Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced former head of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, was found guilty of charges including securities fraud, wire fraud and money laundering by a Manhattan jury — and could now spend the rest of his life in prison. Prosecutors said Bankman-Fried orchestrated “one of the biggest financial frauds in American history” by secretly funneling money from FTX to a private trading firm he controlled. He and his top lieutenants used that money to buy luxury real estate, make political donations and spend on risky investments, prosecutors said. Bankman-Fried is set to be sentenced in March. David Gura / NPR 5. California schools are scrambling to find new ways to get their students milk, thanks to a nationwide shortage of cartons that’s hitting the dairy industry. Hospitals, prisons, nursing homes and other settings with cafeterias are likely to be affected as well. Some advocates say the shortage may be a blessing in disguise — this could force schools to move away from single-use containers, and instead explore reusable ways to deploy the dairy.

In the early 1990s, there were about 650 warehouses in the region; last year, there were nearly 4,000, as the relatively cheap land has become a critical storage-and-sorting point because of its proximity to rail lines to the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.

The LA City Council sparred last night over a vote to extend the police department’s contract to patrol Metro buses and trains amid a rising wave of crime on the public transit system. Two council members dissented from the ultimate 10-2 approval, arguing that unarmed responders, not traditional police, are the solution to the assaults and drug overdoses on Metro lines. David Zahniser and Rachel Uranga / Los Angeles Times 2. Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in 13 counties impacted by this week’s severe winter storms — Los Angeles and San Bernardino included. The declaration should help state agencies assist and coordinate with local governments as crews race to clear roads in mountain communities without power, where residents remain snowed in with dwindling supplies of food and medicine. Josh DuBose / KTLA 3. Common sense is running strong in California’s far north: The Shasta County Board of Supervisors this week voted to cancel its contract with Dominion Voting Systems — the supplier of voting machines and software swept up in baseless Trumpian claims of mass voter fraud — and pursue the possibility of counting all votes by hand. A county supervisor, thankfully, said he consulted MyPillow guy Mike Lindell in making the decision. Jessica Garrison / Los Angeles Times 4. A controversial California bill backed by many of the nation’s big-city mayors could make it easier for authorities to detain people against their will for mental health treatment. Those mayors argue that the bar is too high to treat members of their homeless populations who might be so severely debilitated from mental health or addiction problems that they’re not capable of making decisions for themselves. Adam Beam / Associated Press 5. California could bar commercial salmon fishing for the first time in more than a decade after the fish population along the Pacific Coast plunged to its lowest point in 15 years.

USC will rename Cromwell Field after alumna Allyson Felix, the most decorated American track athlete and poster child of the sport. Fun fact: Felix never actually ran for USC. She signed a pro contract out of high school which voided her NCAA eligibility, but she did attend classes and graduate with a degree from Rossier. Charlotte Phillipp and Nataly Joseph / Annenberg Media 3. A San Francisco art gallery owner caught spraying a homeless woman with a hose in a viral video was arrested Wednesday.

Peter-Astrid Kane / The San Francisco Standard 4. It’ll likely cost some $100 million to clean up the damage in LA County after the multi-week downpour that brought 7 inches of rainfall to parts of the region. Federal aid should help cover part of the costs, which will largely go toward fixing roads, clearing landslides and moving debris. Emily Holshouser / Los Angeles Daily News 5.

The San Francisco Unified School District allowed at least 19 employees accused of sexual misconduct in the last six years to resign or retire instead of being terminated. The practice of handling misconduct allegations in private is more common than the general public might understand, experts say, but federal watchdogs say that the approach allows such abuse to persist. Staff / The San Francisco Standard 5. Gov. Gavin Newsom temporarily relaxed water outflow standards in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, allowing more water to be stored for agricultural use after the governor faced heavy criticism for failing to adequately store January’s heavy rainfall. Environmental advocates quickly decried the move, declaring it a death sentence for endangered fish species. Ashley Rusch / LAist You’re all caught up.

Philadelphia rapper PnB Rock’s slaying in South L.A. has raised concerns about celebrities posting geo-tagged social media posts before they’ve left that location. The rapper’s girlfriend had posted to Instagram with the couple’s location just minutes before the botched robbery that led to his murder, and police are investigating whether that played a role in the rapper’s death. (Noah Goldberg, Richard Winton and Libor Jany / Los Angeles Times) The Los Angeles Unified School District granted Superintendent Alberto Carvalho emergency powers to respond to the Labor Day cyberattack on the district’s computer systems, which continues to be a “pain.” The move grants Carvalho the ability to bypass the traditional public bidding process required when searching for contractors to address the cyberattack, a process which moves slowly and could potentially telegraph the district’s moves to the attacker.

Share this with a friend 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Federal immigration officials arrested a prominent pro-Palestinian protester at Columbia University who holds a green card. It is unclear if the arrest was an isolated, performative incident, or the start of a genuine effort to deport protesters at elite schools the White House has targeted for alleged antisemitism, including USC . Eliza Shapiro / The New York Times 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Related: Days before the Columbia arrest, the State Department said it would start using AI to review tens of thousands of student visa holders’ social media accounts for “pro-jihadist” activity, then deport alleged wrongdoers. “Americans won&#39;t like this,” a First Amendment advocate said. “They&#39;ll view this as capitulating free speech rights.” Marc Caputo / Axios 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Hundreds of USC and UCLA scientists marched Friday outside LA’s federal offices, calling for an end to the Trump administration’s scientific funding cuts and layoffs. One USC professor said his Alzheimer’s research grant has been held up for five weeks, and that the school is becoming more cautious about giving offers to graduate students. Lila Seidman / Los Angeles Times 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Secret audio recordings caught LA police officers in the department’s recruitment office spewing racist comments about Black police applicants, female colleagues, and lesbian and gay officers. “You hit Black people in the liver,” a Latina officer advised her colleagues. “I heard they got weak livers.” Richard Winton and Libor Jany / Los Angeles Times 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Thousands of trees will go unplanted in LA thanks to federal funding cuts ordered by Elon Musk’s DOGE .

It’s Tuesday, and we’re reading about the best ice cream spots in Los Angeles. Onto the five USC, LA and California stories you need to know for today. 1. California community college students who earn associate degrees in select majors will gain priority admission to UCLA starting 2026 under a new law signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom. The program will expand to at least four other University of California schools by 2028, but students won’t be guaranteed admission to their campus of choice. Officials haven’t yet specified which majors will qualify for the program, but have said that at least four of them will be in a science, technology, engineering or math field. Michael Burke / EdSource 2. Two conservative board members in the Orange Unified School District will likely face a recall election because of their roles in firing a superintendent and adopting policies that critics say violate the rights of transgender students. The potential recall is one of the first signs that at least some parents are willing to fight back against the recent wave of transgender policies enacted by conservative California school boards that have embraced cultural wedge issues. Blake Jones / Politico 3. A jury awarded $13.5 million to the family of a man who was killed by LA police officers in 2019 after they pinned him to the ground during an arrest. Officers initially approached Jacobo Juarez Cedillo in Van Nuys suspecting he was under the influence of an unknown drug. The confrontation quickly spiraled, and Cedillo lost consciousness; he died five days later in a hospital from what the coroner said was loss of blood flow to the brain, the effects of methamphetamine and cardiac arrest. Police initially reported his death as an overdose. Summer Lin and Libor Jany / Los Angeles Times 4. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, the utility that serves Northern California, wants to spend $5.9 billion to bury power lines in areas with high fire risk. The utility claims that burying lines reduces the chance that they’ll start a fire by 99%, and that a cheaper protective cover that state regulators have suggested only reduces the risk by 62%. PG&amp;E customers would ultimately shoulder the cost, which could translate to an average of around $40 more on each month’s bill. Adam Beam / Associated Press 5. Olympic officials approved the addition of flag football, cricket, baseball, softball, lacrosse and squash at the 2028 Summer Olympics in LA. The NFL, which has said it plans to use flag football to promote the sport’s international growth, will no doubt be pleased with the decision. The last time the Olympics included American football was in the 1932 Games hosted by LA as a demonstration sport. Staff / ESPN You’re all caught up.

Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. California’s community colleges saw their enrollment grow by a modest 5% last year, a promising development after a pandemic-driven 30-year low in 2020. The gains come with some caveats. The enrollment bump was driven largely by high schoolers taking courses at their local community colleges, and to a lesser extent, adults over 30 who are returning to class; people in their 20s have not returned en masse. Experts say that, when the job market is strong, would-be students have historically chosen to work rather than attend community college. Adam Echelman / CalMatters 2. Hollywood screenwriters will return to work Wednesday, ending the 148-day strike that was the second-longest in Writers Guild of America history. The union is still yet to ratify its contract with Hollywood studios — leaders said a referendum will take place in early October. The actors union is still on strike and has not announced any new bargaining plans. Katie Kilkenny / The Hollywood Reporter 3. An LA nonprofit is suing to overturn Mayor Karen Bass’ declaration of a local housing and homelessness emergency, calling it an “illegal expansion” of mayoral power. Fix the City, the nonprofit, said that the mayor’s declaration has allowed 100% affordable housing developments to circumvent traditional city review, and thus “the mayor permits years of construction for which development planning oversight is non-existent.” David Zahniser / Los Angeles Times 4. California’s top education official said he plans to run for governor in 2026. State Superintendent Tony Thurmond, a Democrat, is the third candidate to announce a gubernatorial bid behind Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis and former state Controller Betty Yee. Current Gov. Gavin Newsom will term out in 2026. If elected, Thurmond would be the first Black person to become California’s governor. Staff / Associated Press 5. The LA Unified School District will no longer require its staff members to vaccinate against COVID-19, putting an end to one of its last pandemic-era mandates. District officials said the requirement is no longer needed to keep schools safely open because the virus is more predictable, spreads less rapidly and more treatments are available.

Yesterday, I walked into (and sat down in) the wrong classroom; realized in the middle of another class that I accidentally registered for the wrong course; and was an hour late to another class that I thought started at 3 p.m. but actually started at 2 p.m. It was a tough day. And now, here are the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. A department of USC’s school of social work said it’ll no longer use the phrases “field work” and “going into the field” in its curriculum — because they could be offensive to immigrant workers and descendants of slaves. Students were left befuddled while Twitter pundits quickly seized on the announcement as yet another example of “woke virtue signaling.” Tomoki Chien / Daily Trojan 2. Folks, the race is on. Rep. Katie Porter announced her 2024 Senate bid, bringing the shadow race to succeed 89-year-old Sen. Dianne Feinstein out into the open. The Orange County Democrat seeks to fill the shoes of the longest-serving female senator, who hasn’t yet announced whether she’ll retire. Staff / NBC News 3. Mayor Karen Bass set her “Inside Safe” initiative into motion by beginning to move people from a long-standing Venice encampment into motel rooms. The estimated 98-person encampment first appeared nearly a decade ago and spans four different streets. David Zahniser and Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times 4. The last 11 days of California storms have left at least 17 dead and put nearly 100,000 residents under evacuation orders or warnings. Parts of the Bay Area have been swamped with more than 11 inches of rain. Staff / The New York Times 5. Gov.

Share this with a friend 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Conservatism is cool again — kind of. Republican clubs at colleges across the U.S. are seeing a spike in enrollment driven largely by outspoken young men. “Trump’s victory is a legitimization,” said one University of Massachusetts senior. “You don’t have to hide politically anymore.” Douglas Belkin / The Wall Street Journal 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A new fire erupted north of Castaic yesterday, already tearing through more than 10,000 acres. The Hughes Fire hasn’t destroyed any structures, but forced officials to issue some 31,000 evacuation orders and briefly close the I5. Closer to home, the smaller Sepulveda fire broke out a mile north of the Getty Center. Tony Kurzweil / KTLA 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] LA’s iconic palm trees are highly flammable, and likely helped spread this month’s devastating fires. That has renewed questions about whether the water-guzzling, non-native plants ought to occupy as much of LA as they do. “We don’t have to be draconian about this, but we have to be thoughtful,” a UCLA researcher said.

Anna has a meticulous attention to detail matched by few journalists I’ve worked with, and is an excellent addition to this team. She’s a freshman (like myself) majoring in computer engineering and computer science (unlike myself). Yes, mom, I see now that I could’ve done both journalism and CS. Anyways… here are the USC, L.A. and California stories you need to know for today. 1. A group of constituents filed initial paperwork to recall Los Angeles City Councilmember Kevin de León, who has thus far resisted calls to resign after his role in a racist conversation with two other council members and a labor leader. Under state law, it’s fairly easy to launch an initial recall attempt, but triggering an actual election is more difficult — recall backers would likely have to collect some 25,000 signatures in District 14 for that to happen. Julia Wick and Dakota Smith / Los Angeles Times 2. If you looked to the sky last night, chances are you saw it. SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base at around 6:15 p.m., transporting 53 Starlink satellites into orbit. This particular rocket — which is reusable — has completed eight liftoffs and landings so far. Vivian Chow / KTLA 3. Monkeypox cases in L.A. County continue to decline, likely evidence that vaccines and treatments are protecting against further spread of the virus. The county has reported 2,314 cases since the start of the outbreak. Rong-Gong Lin II and Luke Money / Los Angeles Times 4. A mountain lion wandering near a Brentwood country club prompted a school lockdown and brought traffic to a halt. First spotted in the morning, wildlife officials didn't tranquilize and capture the lion until 4:30 p.m. in the backyard of a home. It wasn’t immediately clear where the lion would be taken. Paige Austin / Patch 5. Environmentalists and trucking groups clashed with clean air regulators in the first public hearing for a law that would ban manufacturers from selling new gas-powered medium-duty and heavy-duty trucks by 2040. The environmentalists called for tougher rules, and trucking companies said the proposal ignores concerns about electric vehicle costs, lack of infrastructure and job losses. Nadia Lopez / CalMatters 6. Election officials in California’s Shasta County are apprehensive as the midterms loom near. The county, which sits in the state’s rural far north, has been a hot spot for election denial ever since former President Donald Trump spread the lie that voter fraud cost him the White House. Shasta County officials have largely been spared the death threats of places like Maricopa County, Arizona, but they still say a small group of locals are showing bullying and aggressive behavior. Shawn Hubler / The New York Times 7. A South Los Angeles man whose cache of illegal fireworks blew up a neighborhood in a botched bomb squad detonation was sentenced to five months in prison on Wednesday. In June 2021, police found 16 tons of illegal commercial and homemade fireworks in the man’s home — but the L.A. Police Department bungled a controlled detonation by loading more explosives into an armored containment vessel than it was rated for. The ensuing explosion injured 17 and inflicted mass property damage in the neighborhood. Associated Press Nation / world Democratic leaders are urging midterm candidates to confront economic anxieties head-on in the home stretch of the election run-up, an about-face from previous messaging to stick primarily to the abortion debate.

He tracks a $100 million super yacht as it sails port to port — specifically, Rick Caruso ’s $100 million super yacht. The screenwriting professor tweets daily updates on the mayoral candidate’s yacht with information parsed from public maritime tracking websites.

It’s Friday, and we’re still hoping that SC can make it to the Pac-12 championship . Let’s start by beating Cal tomorrow. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. The famous Murphy’s Law says: “Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.” That seems to be the case at the embattled Hub LA Figueroa apartments, where, last week, a contractor died in a “tragic accident.” No other details were immediately available. Local authorities investigating the death said they found the site safe for work, but the move-in date for the complex was pushed back a third time to Nov. 11. Students who signed leases at the building are still in temporary accommodations at the Lorenzo Apartments, where they were moved earlier this month after being booted from downtown hotels. Kate Stuzin and Robert Westermann / USC Annenberg Media 2. Law enforcement officials plan to investigate some San Francisco opioid deaths as homicides starting next year, a major escalation of the city’s effort to tamp down on fentanyl use. The initiative is sponsored by Gov. Gavin Newsom and Mayor London Breed, and will no doubt spark fierce pushback from critics who say the focus on arresting street-level dealers is reminiscent of failed “war-on-drugs” policies, and that addiction needs to be treated instead as a public health emergency. J.D. Morris / San Francisco Chronicle 3. Two flight attendants sued United Airlines alleging they were removed from working charter flights for the LA Dodgers because they weren’t white, thin and young. Darby Quezada, 44, and Dawn Todd, 50 — both women of color — also alleged that other flight attendants referred to Quezada as the “flight maid” because she’s Mexican, and that they were told white attendants fit a “certain look” the Dodgers like. Charter flights are considered a cushy assignment: Attendants earn more money, higher per diems and often receive sports tickets and rare merchandise. Tony Saavedra / Orange County Register 4. California officials will drop hundreds of thousands of fruit flies over regions of LA — including USC — in an effort to stamp out an invasive population of Mediterranean fruit flies. The effort might sound counterintuitive, but it’s a birth control measure: The flies will be sterile males, a common method for dealing with invasive insects that officials hope will resolve the invasion within six months. Authorities say that if the invasive population spirals out of control, the state’s agriculture industry could lose up to $1.8 billion a year. Ariana Bindman / SFGate 5. Breaking Bad fans, rejoice. A six-bedroom San Jose home — which houses an “inactive meth lab and meth contamination” — is on the market for $1.55 million. The home was also allegedly used to stockpile firearms and build homemade explosives used to destroy several Pacific Gas &amp; Electric transformers in 2022 and 2023; the previous owner, 35-year-old Peter Karasev, faces a federal indictment. The best part is that the home is being sold as is, meaning the next owner gets to clean up the meth lab. Christian Martinez / Los Angeles Times You’re all caught up.

Share this with a friend 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] When USC cleared its second encampment the other night, cops blocked student journalists from getting close enough to cover it. One officer told Annenberg Media students that if they “act like the media, we’re going to treat you like the media.” But miraculously, KCLA was still allowed on campus to cover the sweep. Meanwhile, more than 100 people were arrested at UCLA and UCSD yesterday. And despite disciplinary action and arrests, USC students still plan to take part in the nationwide All Out for Rafah protests later today. Stephanie Kaloi / The Wrap 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] California’s historic piers are collapsing, and the state is pouring millions into repairs every year. Santa Monica Pier is a case-in-point: Just a few years after officials voted to preserve it forever, violent winter storms swept away a third of the pier. Thus, the pier we know today — carousel and all — was born. Yet every year, the city spends close to $10 million on routine upkeep, causing officials to question whether or not preserving nostalgia and tourist attractions is worth the bill. Tessa McLean / SFGate 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] LAX’s people-mover train just bagged another $200 million, bringing its total operating budget to nearly $3 billion. Despite the influx of cash, it’s not looking like the automated train will open any time soon. And it’s also unclear what the extra money will go towards, besides settling vague dispute claims brought on by the project’s contractor. As it stands right now, the project is 96% complete, though. Caitlin Hernández / LAist 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The tiny, 4-year-old publication Lookout Santa Cruz just won the Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News for its coverage of the catastrophic flooding and mudslides in January 2023. With just 10 editorial staffers, Lookout Santa Cruz provided “detailed and nimble community-focused coverage,” which won the nation&#39;s top journalism award. This makes it one of the youngest and smallest publications ever to join Pulitzer heavyweights such as the New York Times and Washington Post. Rick Edmonds / Poynter 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Picture this: Gov. Gavin Newsom majestically perched atop the Golden Gate Bridge, the city behind him and signature aviators glinting in the sun as he touts California’s greatness. The occasion? The state’s tourism numbers have reached an all-time high. With $150.4 billion spent in 2023, travel revenue has finally surpassed pre-pandemic numbers. Los Angeles, San Diego and Orange counties are among those to exceed 2019’s standard. Ironically, the one place Newsom chose to announce the news, San Francisco, is not quite there yet.

I had it in there last night but cut it last-minute this morning to make way for another story. (You can thank my dad for catching this.) The Daily Trojan sent me to the tent to take photos for that story yesterday, and I’m happy to report that having “head honcho cock strokers,” spanking paddles and rainbow dildos out on a public table felt every bit as absurd as you might think.

The Los Angeles City Council voted to censure Councilmembers Kevin de León and Gil Cedillo, along with former Councilmember Nury Martinez for their roles in a conversation containing racist remarks. It was the first time in at least a century that the council censured any of its own members. Linh Taht / Los Angeles Daily News 2. Missed the voter registration deadline? Don’t fret. You can still complete the conditional registration process at early voting locations within walking distance — and the USC free Lyft zone — in the next two weeks before the November elections. Alexa Hernandez Diaz and AC Shick / Annenberg Media 3. The L.A. County jail system is failing to meet standards meant to protect inmates with mental illnesses, a court-appointed monitor said. A 2015 settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice — after the county was cited for mistreating inmates with mental illnesses years before — required at least 10 hours of out-of-cell time for some of the jail’s mental health population. The monitor’s report says less than 15% of the jail’s sickest were offered that required time during the first quarter of 2022. Robert Garrova / LAist 4. Firefighters were battling a blaze at a boarded-up commercial building in downtown L.A. Wednesday night. At least 120 firefighters responded to the structure fire in the three-story building. Gregory Yee / Los Angeles Times 5. USC professor Howard Rodman has a bit of an odd hobby. He tracks a $100 million super yacht as it sails port to port — specifically, Rick Caruso ’s $100 million super yacht. The screenwriting professor Tweets daily updates on the mayoral candidate’s yacht with information parsed from public maritime tracking websites. Lyla Bhalla-Ladd, Jack Hallinan, Ben Cohen and Salome Nebiyu / Annenberg Media 6. The rapper formerly known as Kanye West showed up unannounced at Skechers headquarters in Manhattan Beach, and was subsequently escorted from the building. The self-invite came a day after Adidas ended its partnership with the artist following his antisemitic remarks. Matt Stevens / The New York Times 7. An attorney for Harvey Weinstein grilled a witness to tears for a lack of evidence that the former movie mogul raped her nearly a decade ago. In the early stages of Weinstein’s L.A. trial, the defense has tried to poke holes in witness testimony and highlight positive Instagram posts that the aforementioned witness made in the days after the alleged rape. Staff / The Guardian Nation / world Tech’s biggest companies are reporting declining or plateauing profits, a worrying sign for the economy ahead.

Share this with a friend 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A small group of peaceful counterprotesters demonstrated next to USC’s pro-Palestinian encampment early this morning. “You support a brutal terrorist organization that rapes women and kills babies,” the group broadcasted over speakers in between clips of Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel. “You fucking Zionist pig,” one student shouted back. Separately: USC promised a lavish graduate celebration in the Coliseum including “surprise performances” and a “special gift.” I’m salivating. Staff / Daily Trojan 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] In the days leading up to a violent attack by pro-Israeli counterprotesters on UCLA’s pro-Palestinian encampment, university leadership requested police backup twice — but canceled the asks within hours. The revelation comes as UCLA faces heavy criticism for taking hours to intervene when counterprotesters threw bricks and fireworks then beat pro-Palestinian demonstrators. The school contends that its police force was simply overwhelmed. Noah Goldberg / Los Angeles Times 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Long Beach officials declared a public health emergency after a tuberculosis outbreak killed one person and hospitalized nine others. Health officials said at least 170 more people were likely exposed to the disease, but that the spread was limited to one hotel. The outbreak comes after tuberculosis cases in California rose by 15% last year, which is the highest year-over-year increase since 1989. Andrew J. Campa / Los Angeles Times 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A scuba dive boat captain was sentenced to four years in prison for his role in a 2019 fire that killed 34 people in a vessel off the California coast — the deadliest maritime disaster in recent U.S. history. Prosecutors said Captain Jerry Boylan failed to post an appropriate night watch and didn’t properly train his crew in firefighting. When the blaze broke out, Boylan was the first person to abandon ship while 34 victims were trapped below deck. Stefanie Dazio and Amy Taxin / Associated Press 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] There’s drama at the Getty. A European human rights court ruled that the famous J. Paul Getty Museum in LA is unlawfully in possession of an Italian artifact: and that Italy has the right to seize it. The piece in question is a life-size bronze statue dubbed “ Victorious Youth ” that Italian officials say was illegally smuggled out of the country, then sold to the Getty on the international art market.

Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Environmental regulators slammed the operator of an LA County landfill for failing to notify nearby residents that its Castaic facility is spewing toxic, carcinogenic fumes into the air and water. Officials say a fire is burning deep in the Chiquita Canyon Landfill, causing a pressure buildup and “almost volcanic” hot liquid to burst through the site like geysers. Regulators mandated that the operator more frequently remove wastewater and provide real-time air quality data to nearby communities. Tony Briscoe / Los Angeles Times 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Neuralink, a company that’s developing computers to implant in brains, said it placed a device in its first human patient Sunday. The Fremont-based company owned by Elon Musk didn’t say who the patient was or whether the device is working. The company has in the past said it’d conduct its first clinical trials on people with limited use of their hands because of spinal cord injuries or neurological disorders, and the Food and Drug Administration approved human trials last May. The devices, Musk said, will let users control phones and computers “just by thinking.” Ryan Mac / The New York Times 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] It was a slow start to the winter, but a series of storms starting tonight are expected to bring the Sierra Nevada snowpack closer to its average levels. Already, a handful of storms in recent weeks brought the pack to 52% of its normal level, tempering talk of a “snow drought” and providing some relief to ski resorts. Experts expect California to be in “OK” shape water-wise this year — barring a complete shutoff of rain and snow in mid-February — in part because last year’s historic winter replenished reservoirs to levels not seen in years. Paul Rogers / The Mercury News 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] California lawmakers proposed a bill that would give parents the power to remove addictive algorithmic feeds from their kids’ social media apps, and instead force platforms to display posts in chronological order — which is proven to be less habit-forming. The bill would also let parents block all social media notifications and access to the apps during school hours. “Countless studies show that once a young person has a social media addiction, they experience higher rates of depression, anxiety and low self-esteem,” wrote one of the bill’s sponsors. Will Shanklin / Engadget 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] NASA’s retired space shuttle Endeavor was lifted into an upright launch position overnight by crews at the California Science Center just across the street from USC. It took a 450-foot-tall crane to lift the behemoth into a position that museum officials said had never before been accomplished outside of a NASA or Air Force facility. You won’t get to see the actual exhibit just yet: Construction of the building that’ll surround Endeavor is expected to take another 18 months.

Here are the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. COVID is spiking in LA: And so is pandemic indifference. Last month’s tripling in hospitalizations again raised the specter of an indoor mask mandate. But in the age of widespread vaccinations, many Angelenos are likely to see masking as a nuisance rather than a life-saving measure as they once might’ve. Corina Knoll and Sarah Cahalan / The New York Times 2. San Francisco supervisors backtracked a policy that would’ve allowed the city’s police force to deploy robots to kill suspects in limited instances. The policy is now up for revision and the supervisors are expected to make a final call next week. J.D. Morris / San Francisco Chronicle 3. All new LA buildings will soon have to run solely on electric power, under a new policy approved by the City Council. Accessory dwelling units and cooking equipment in restaurants are exempt, but all other appliances — e.g., water heaters, clothes dryers and stoves — must otherwise be all-electric. Eric He / City News Service 4. LA Public Library card holders can now check out laptops from any library location. The Chromebooks and internet hotspots are available to any adult patron “in good standing” for long-term use. Tyler Wayne / LAist 5. Officials feared the worst: four possible overdoses, this time on a Moreno Valley middle school campus. Turns out the students were high on cannabis-infused gummies. Three were hospitalized for vomiting and pale complexions but are expected to make a full recovery in an incident that followed a similar scare at Van Nuys Middle School last week — in the context of a string of recent tragic teen fentanyl deaths.

Share this with a friend 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A coyote – or two – has made USC its new home, startling a few students in the process. DPS said it has received multiple reports of spottings but none of any attacks. Officials advised students not to run if they see a coyote and to call DPS should it become aggressive. Asiana Guang / Daily Trojan 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A viral tweet last week claimed that ICE was deporting a UCLA Chinese international student for participating in a pro-Palestinian protest. That was false. In fact, the tweet didn’t even properly identify the student in the photo. The incident adds to the growing frenzy of misinformation about deportations since Donald Trump’s inauguration. Staff / Annenberg Media 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Many fire hydrants in neighborhoods affected by the Palisades fire were aging, outdated outlets considered unsuitable even for “normal fire-protection service,” an investigation found. The revelation is another in a long list of fire preparation oversights, including when a lack of water pressure dried up the town’s pipes during the blazes. Mike Baker and Robert Gebeloff / The New York Times 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Protesters thundered through downtown yesterday for a third straight day of demonstrations against Trump’s immigration crackdown. Tuesday’s group was largely comprised of students who walked out of class; LA Unified’s attendance was down 27 percentage points. At least one person was arrested for vandalism. Clara Harter / Los Angeles Times 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Kamala Harris earned her first major endorsement for California governor — and she hasn’t even said if she’s running yet.

A 22-year-old driver was arrested on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter for allegedly killing four Pepperdine University seniors walking along the Pacific Coast Highway on Tuesday. Two other victims remain in the hospital with no word on their conditions. Investigators said Fraser Bohm, the suspect, was driving at a high speed at nighttime, lost control and sideswiped three parked vehicles which then crashed into the group of pedestrians. Police said Bohm was sober. Staff / ABC7 2. Gov. Gavin Newsom approved $10 million in state funding to post more police officers outside religious buildings, including mosques and synagogues, in an effort to prevent hate crimes during the Israel-Gaza war. The funds will be used to reimburse departments for the overtime costs they incur. Newsom also allocated an additional $20 million to a program that allows nonprofits to apply for increased security measures. Jeremy Childs / Los Angeles Times 3. A veteran LA Police Department detective accused multiple colleagues of sexual hazing Monday in a legal claim, which is a precursor to a lawsuit. The detective said the abuse occurred in 2009 when he was a rookie cop playing on the department’s amateur football team. His teammates — including several who are now high-ranking officers, and one in prison for raping women in the line of duty — allegedly forced him to strip before grabbing him, hurling liquids at him, yelling at him to show his penis and at one point ramming a hard object up his anus. Richard Winton and Libor Jany / Los Angeles Times 4. California school districts have made little to no progress in reversing steep declines in test scores wrought by the pandemic, according to a state report that was largely in line with the district-specific data LA Unified released a day earlier. Notably, the proficiency gap between Black and Latino students and their white and Asian counterparts showed little change. For instance, only 1 in 6 Black students and 1 in 5 Latinos met the state standard for math proficiency, compared to half of white students and 7 in 10 Asians. John Fensterwald and Daniel J. Willis / EdSource 5. Allied counterintelligence officials warned that more than half of China’s espionage efforts are focused in Silicon Valley — not Washington, which is traditionally considered the key intelligence battleground in the United States. The heads of the FBI, Britain’s MI5 and their commonwealth counterparts said after an unusual gathering at Stanford University that Chinese spies have a particular interest in artificial intelligence, and that Western officials are working with the private sector to detect and stop the Chinese efforts.

Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The director of “Crazy Rich Asians” will deliver this year’s commencement address. Jon M. Chu, who most recently directed the soon-to-be-released “Wicked” starring Ariana Grande, is a graduate of USC’s cinema school and said he’s “humbled” to return to his alma mater. Chu is also well-known for directing “In the Heights,” the musical film written by Lin Manuel Miranda. “I feel very privileged actually, to be able to speak to these young people who are going to be changing the world in the future,” he said. Fun fact: Chu is a Bay Area native and son of the famous Chef Chu . Laya Albert / Annenberg Media 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC’s tuition consistently outpaces inflation. In fact, the only two years since 2004 where inflation beat out tuition increases were 2021 and 2022 — but those were anomalies, because the pandemic caused an irregular spike in prices. The university has since accelerated the pace of its tuition hikes and wasn’t particularly forthcoming when asked what justifies the ballooning prices, writing: “Tuition is the largest source of the university’s academic operating budget.” All those tuition bumps mean that, adjusted for inflation, a USC degree in 2004 cost just $48,104. Compare that to today’s $69,904. Related: Here’s a look at USC’s growing presidential salary . Tomoki Chien / College Brief 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Elsewhere in Trojanland, a woman who pleaded guilty to paying a fraudster to secure her son admission at USC is trying to clear her name. In 2021, Elisabeth Kimmel was sentenced to just six weeks in a medical prison for paying the infamous William “Rick” Singer $250,000 to get her son a USC pole vaulting scholarship; her son is not a pole vaulter. Now, Kimmel claims her conviction violated the Constitution. She says her purportedly poor health meant a lengthy trial would have risked her life, and that’s the only reason she pleaded guilty. Prosecutors say her argument is “built on an Alice-in-Wonderland version of events.” Without the plea deal, Kimmel could’ve served up to 20 years in prison. Flint McColgan / Boston Herald 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] We may never know whether Gov. Gavin Newsom pushed for an exemption in a wage law to benefit one of his billionaire donors: because everybody at the negotiating table signed nondisclosure agreements at the behest of the workers union. Newsom’s much-touted law will raise the minimum wage for fast food workers to $20 per hour come April. But the governor took flak this week after Bloomberg reported that an oddly specific line in the law — which exempts restaurants who bake and sell bread a-la-carte from the wage hike — would benefit a long-time Newsom donor who owns two dozen Panera Bread franchises. The donor, facing just as much flak as Newsom, said he’ll abide by the $20 minimum wage. Ashley Zavala / KCRA 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Huntington Beach voters approved a measure that bans nongovernmental flags from flying on city property — namely, the Pride flag. Breast cancer awareness and religious flags are also banned, but POW-MIA and Olympic banners aren’t. It’s an unsurprising development for a city that’s become the latest arena for culture war theatrics. This is the same town that banned mask and vaccine mandates, established a panel to review children’s library books for allegedly sexual content and regularly assails Joe Biden’s immigration policies. “A lot of this is taking Huntington Beach back to how it was,” said the city’s mayor, who supported the measure.

Here are the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Crime in University Park hit a decade high in October 2022, reaching numbers not seen since January 2010. Data from the LA Police Department reported 236 crimes in October, followed by the second-highest count of 221 reported in November. Staff / Daily Trojan 2. The seven states that rely on the Colorado River for their water failed to meet a federal end-of-January deadline to hash out a plan to collectively reduce their water use. California — which draws the most water from the dying river — was the lone holdout in a plan that outlined possible cuts accounting for evaporation in the river’s lower basin. Ian James / Los Angeles Times 3. The shooters responsible for the gruesome “assassination-style” murders of six people in Tulare County remain at-large two weeks later. Authorities are yet to establish a motive in the killings, though Sheriff Mike Boudreaux said investigators believe they may have been gang-related. Staff / Associated Press 4. Authorities said a California man intentionally drove his family off a 250-foot cliff on the Highway 1: a fall which all four members of his family, himself included, miraculously survived. Dharmesh Patel, 41, was charged with three counts of attempted murder on Monday. Livia Albeck-Ripka / The New York Times 5. David DePape, the man accused of attacking Paul Pelosi in October, called a local television station to say “you’re welcome” for attacking Pelosi and that he’s “so sorry I didn’t get more of them.” DePape called from a county jail where he’s awaiting his trial set for later this month.

Onto the five USC, LA and California stories you need to know for today. 1. The California State University system approved a 6% annual tuition hike over the next five years, a move that’s expected to raise some $148 million dollars for the cash-strapped system. Students and the faculty union were quick to slam the move, noting that the system’s incoming chancellor will make over $1 million a year. The tuition hike will amount to a $1,940 increase between now and 2028, bringing full-time undergraduate tuition to $7,682. Mikhail Zinshteyn / CalMatters 2. It’s the final day of California’s legislative session, and lawmakers are scrambling to pass some of the most high-profile bills of the year before they shut down and reconvene in January. Those bills are expected to tackle the housing crisis, fentanyl epidemic and labor battles — among other contentious topics. Soumya Karlamangla / The New York Times 3. Gov. Gavin Newsom said he plans to intervene in a legal battle over San Francisco’s ability to clear homeless encampments. The city, thanks to a lawsuit filed by advocate groups, is under a temporary court order that bars it from enforcing anti-camping laws until it offers more shelter beds for unhoused people. Newsom sided with the city, saying the order stops it from shutting down unsafe encampments and that “it’s unacceptable what’s happening on the streets and sidewalks.” Shawna Chen / Axios 4. Two groups are suing to halt LA’s planned renovation of the Los Angeles Zoo in Griffith Park. Friends of Griffith Park and the Griffith J. Griffith Charitable Trust alleged that the city did not address the outsized environmental impacts of the renovation which would include removing 16 acres of native vegetation. The city wants to develop the zoo in time for the 2028 Summer Olympics. Dakota Smith / Los Angeles Times 5. Highway patrol officers in the Central Valley city of Merced arrested a man for driving under the influence — not behind the wheel of a car, but on his horse. Nobody was hurt in the incident. “The rules of the road apply to those operating animals on the highway,” law enforcement wrote on social media. Jenna Amatulli / The Guardian You’re all caught up.

Access free LA Times subs for USC students here . 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Tens of thousands of California State University faculty plan to launch a five-day strike on Jan. 22, protesting a 5% pay hike offered by the university system that fell far short of the 12% the union asked for. The strike, which will affect all 23 CSU campuses, will see professors, lecturers, counselors, librarians and coaches walk off the job. CSU says the union’s demands are “not financially viable”; faculty say only 12% can keep pace with inflation. Nanette Asimov / San Francisco Chronicle 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] An ACLU report found that K-9s used by state law enforcement agencies inflict “unnecessary, disproportionate” harm on people who commit minor crimes. Two in three people severely injured by K-9s are people of color, and nearly half show signs of a mental health disability or crisis, the report notes. ACLU advocates said a lack of statewide regulations on K-9 training could be partly to blame, a characterization that law enforcement representatives contested. Defne Karabatur / Los Angeles Times 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] It’s no secret that the news industry is in trouble. Tuesday was just another reminder, when Kevin Merida, the executive editor of the LA Times, said he’s stepping down. Merida’s abrupt departure from the largest newspaper in the West was something of a surprise to the media industry, already unsettled by a seemingly unending series of layoffs. Pundits say Merida’s departure is likely over financial woes: The paper has fallen far short of its digital subscription goals, and sources say the Times is looking to cut another $10 million from its budget — perhaps a task that Merida was not interested in. Benjamin Mullin / The New York Times 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A former soccer coach at California State University, Northridge alleged he was fired in retaliation for exposing wrongdoing at the university, including being told to recruit an athlete whose uncle was likely to donate generously to the school. Keith Andrew West, 50, alleged in a lawsuit that the school’s then-athletic director texted him, “If you don’t get this kid, I&#39;ll fire you.” West listed CSUN and the university system’s board of trustees as defendants in his suit. Bill Hetherman / City News Service 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] An LA man was sentenced to four years in prison for falsely claiming he was sexually assaulted by Hollywood executives in 2018. Prosecutors said Rovier Carrington, 34, fabricated emails that made it seem like he’d been assaulted by two executives who he claimed prevented him from producing a reality television program. Carrington also claimed he’s “related to Hollywood royalty,” being the great-grandson of one of “The Three Stooges” actors.

Notably, the deal will retroactively increase salaries by 5% to last July, then by another 5% at the start of this July. That’s short of the union’s ask for 12%, but more than CSU’s original offer. Professors are expected to return to the classroom today. Soumya Karlamangla / The New York Times 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Authorities are searching for the people who set off a massive display of illegal fireworks in Little Tokyo Sunday night. Police said the culprits set off an estimated 100 pounds of pyrotechnics from a parking lot next to the Geffen Contemporary at MOCA that rocked the neighborhood for almost a half hour. The sound of illegal fireworks is fairly common in downtown LA, but the scale of Sunday’s display was unusual. Josh DuBose / KTLA 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Last night’s Senate debate was a dogpile — with Republican Steve Garvey at the bottom. Despite a healthy share of interparty nastiness, veteran Democratic Reps. Katie Porter, Adam Schiff and Barbara Lee skewered the former LA Dodgers star’s vague policy positions and repeatedly pressed him to say whether he’ll vote for Donald Trump this year. “Once a Dodger, always a dodger,” Porter said when Garvey sidestepped the question. Jeremy B. White and Lara Korte / Politico 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Heavy rain and flash floods wreaked havoc in San Diego yesterday, flooding entire neighborhoods and overturning cars. The city’s mayor declared a state of emergency and officials set up shelters for displaced residents. Such rain is unusual for San Diego: In a period of just three hours yesterday, parts of the region were inundated with more rain than they average in a month.

You have to let him skate your pool. Steve Alba, 60, professional skateboarder and owner of Salba Pool Cleaning, came of age in the 1970s when skateboarders typically took to empty pools and asphalt embankments. Since then, some 3,500 dedicated skateparks have cropped up over the U.S., but pools still hold a special allure. They’re more interesting. And there aren’t any mouth-breathing tweens. “On the one hand it’s a facade, to make us look official,” Alba said. “The ultimate goal is to skate the pool.” Jacob Bunge / The Wall Street Journal p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Earn gift cards when your friends subscribe to Morning, Trojan using your custom URL . 5 referrals = $5 at Starbucks 10 referrals = $10 at Insomnia Cookies 25 referrals = $50 at USC Bookstore OR a Morning, Trojan t-shirt p span[style*=\"font-size\"] You have } referrals, } to go until earning a }.

It’s Friday, and we’re reading about how a fisherman discovered a 7-foot gator just outside of Sacramento. Onto the five other USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Undergraduate student workers in the California State University system are looking to unionize, calling for higher wages in their assistant jobs doing things like filing paperwork and checking out library books. The move comes on the heels of other large campus labor movements, though those efforts have thus far been concentrated in graduate schools. Rocky Walker / CalMatters 2. A tech consultant and entrepreneur was charged in last week’s murder of Cash App founder Bob Lee in San Francisco. Nima Momeni, 38, allegedly stabbed Lee twice in the chest in broad daylight in the city’s wealthy Rincon Hill neighborhood. Authorities are yet to uncover a motive but said that the two men knew each other. Staff / San Francisco Chronicle 3. Thanks to this winter’s heavy storms, California’s three-year drought has dwindled from covering 99% of the state to a mere 9%, the U.S. Drought Monitor reported. The remaining drought-afflicted areas are concentrated in the state’s far north and southeast and are surrounded by areas of “abnormal dryness.” Staff / Associated Press 4. Police officers in the Northern California city of Antioch referred to Black people as “zoo” animals and bragged about kicking a suspect’s head “like a field goal” in newly revealed texts messages loaded with racial epithets. The texts added to a growing FBI investigation into the department, where one-fifth of the force is already suspended for misconduct. Jakob Rogers and Nate Gartrell / East Bay Times 5. An exodus of wealthy white collar workers in the San Francisco Bay Area is raising fears of a “doom loop.” The workers, liberated by remote work options, are moving to cheaper cities where they can buy less expensive homes and save for early retirement. But they take with them their tax revenue, leaving Bay Area cities with growing budget shortfalls and dying downtowns. Ethan Varian / The Mercury News You’re all caught up.

Print production will now run three days a week rather than five. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “This is all really sudden and really upsetting but they’ve told us despite our objections that their decision is final,” wrote incoming editor-in-chief Stefano Fendrich in a Sunday evening Slack message, referring to USC’s Student Life department. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Fendrich declined to comment for this story. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The cut comes after the paper’s managing editors issued an impassioned, if ineffective, plea for “ control of our budget ” earlier this month. It also comes as USC’s central administration slashes budgets across the university to rectify recent financial woes . p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “It’s caused a lot of turmoil,” said a Daily Trojan editor who asked not to publish his name because he wasn’t authorized to speak to the press. “A lot of people are second-guessing whether they’ll come back.” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The editor added that he and several colleagues felt “blindsided” by the letter published by the paper’s managing editors earlier this month. They were not previously aware that such significant cuts were on the table, he said. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “We realize this news is frustrating, and may affect your ability to participate in the spring,” Fendrich wrote in his internal announcement. “We are working to find solutions and are meeting with USC administrators and leaders at other college newspapers to develop proposals.” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The cuts mark a tumultuous start for Fendrich, who will inherit a 112-year-old organization facing one of its most radical changes in recent memory. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Fendrich faces the formidable task of consolidating his staff while competing with rival Annenberg Media, whose digital coverage last year turned the outlet into a serious competitor of the Daily Trojan’s for the first time ever. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Annenberg Media faced its own budget cuts earlier this year which forced it to slash several paid newsroom roles, an editor at the outlet said. The school-affiliated publication pays its editors minimum wage — far more than the Daily Trojan’s traditional stipends — but does not compensate contributing reporters."},{"slug":"death-toll-rises","title":"Death toll rises","date":1707321600000,"web_exclusive":false,"content":".bh__byline_wrapper .bh__byline_social_wrapper .bh__byline_social_wrapper > * + * @media (min-width: 768px) .bh__byline_social_wrapper } Death toll rises Tomo Chien February 07, 2024 p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Good morning.

Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The death toll rose to nine in this week’s record-breaking storm, the worst of which is expected to move on today. Still, officials warned that it’ll take very little additional rain to cause more flooding and mudslides thanks to the heavily saturated soil. LA County has seen at least 475 mudslides and 390 fallen trees since the outbreak of the storm. San Diego County briefly flirted with the possibility of a tornado yesterday, and at UC Santa Barbara, students were evacuated from an apartment after a bluff collapsed in front of the building. Staff / Los Angeles Times 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] AT&T wants to pull the plug on landline services for most of California, including broad swaths of LA, arguing that the technology is “fast becoming a historical curiosity.” The telecommunications giant holds monopoly status, meaning customers have no other alternative. But old habits die hard. Rural residents, worrying of wildfires and medical emergencies, say they can’t rely on cell service and frequent power outages make internet service unreliable. “The consequences are life-threatening,” one policy director said. Ethan Baron / The Mercury News 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The contender raising the most money in recent months to succeed Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2026 hasn’t even declared his candidacy yet. Attorney General Rob Bonta — who says he’s “seriously considering” a run for the governorship — reported over $2 million in campaign contributions in the last seven months. That’s a half million more than the leading declared candidate, Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, raised in the same time period. Unions are the top contributors to Bonta’s war chest. Sophia Bollag / San Francisco Chronicle 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] In this town, you can sip a craft beer at a bar where customers pay on the honor system, walk barefoot through a vegan cafe, browse a bookstore decorated with photos of Che Guevara and shop at a craft market in a converted bedsheet factory. Tech employees flocked here during the pandemic, looking to escape the suffocating political environment of big cities. Sound like somewhere in California? It’s not. Try “Dalifornia,” the Chinese mountain city of Dali that styles its easy-living ethos after the Golden State. Vivian Wang / The New York Times 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] It was close to midnight, and somebody waiting at a bus stop noticed something peculiar in a window above San Francisco’s Union Square. A bright red light was flashing “SOS” in Morse Code out the top floor of the Hotel Stratford, and the person at the bus stop quickly posted a video of it on Reddit. Could this be a distress signal? Thousands of commenters weighed in, some suggesting this could be a desperate cry for help from a victim of sex trafficking. Not so. “We have an eccentric tenant in that unit,” the hotel manager said. “He is fine.” Police agreed with the assessment.

The hackers that broke into L.A.

But a ransomware attack on the largest school district in America might’ve been a step too far.

Hundreds of women have accused him of abuse during his 35-year tenure.

( Howard Blume / Los Angeles Times ) 🌅 California California has long generated the most initial public offerings in any U.S. state — but that could change this year. Only nine companies headquartered in the Golden State went public during the first three quarters of 2022, compared with 81 that launched IPOs during the same period last year. At the moment, Massachusetts has the lead with 10 IPOs. ( Linly Lin / Bloomberg ) The state’s record-breaking 2020 fire season might’ve undone two decades of efforts to cut carbon dioxide emissions, according to UCLA and University of Chicago researchers. ( Hayley Smith / Los Angeles Times ) But wait: There’s more. Emissions by large facilities like power plants and refineries went up in 2021 compared with the year before, putting a dent in the state’s goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030.

Also, check out this new publication called Semafor . It’s an outlet trying to disrupt the longstanding template for the classic news report, founded by some pretty big name journalists (including Ben Smith, who I’ve had much respect for after reading this piece a while back). It’s sort of like Axios , but better. I’m not convinced (yet) that this is the solution journalism needs, but I’m all for people looking to disrupt an industry in dire need of change. My only gripe is that they stole my off-white background. 🚨 In case you missed it Kevin de León was clear: He’s not resigning.

Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The Democratic mayors of San Francisco and San Jose endorsed a ballot measure that would crack down on crime and drugs. If approved, the measure would roll back parts of Proposition 47, which in 2014 raised the threshold to prosecute shoplifters and lowered penalties for drug possession, among other criminal justice reforms. Prop 47 was approved by nearly 60% of voters in its day — but times are changing. The support of two prominent Democratic mayors reflects a growing desire to tamp down on the state’s image as the home of runaway crime and drug use. John Woolfolk / The Mercury News 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Caltrans said it wants to ban flammable materials in lots under freeway overpasses and vet tenants for prior lease violations, an effort to remedy the regulatory failures that led to the fire that shut down the Interstate 10 for a week in November. The agency, which manages the state highway system, also suggested requiring that leases define what materials are allowed in a given lot and how they must be stored. It’ll be up to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office to approve the recommendations. Yusra Farzan / LAist 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A California bill could ban plastic bags from grocery stores entirely. In 2014, the state banned the formerly ubiquitous thin plastic bags from stores but allowed for the thicker plastic versions that are, in theory, reusable and recyclable. The reality is that very few people reuse or recycle those bags. One study found that the average person trashed around 8 pounds of plastic bags per year in 2004, compared to 11 pounds in 2021. Of note: Newsom, who must sign off on the law if passed in the Legislature, signed the nation’s first plastic bag ban in 2007 as mayor of San Francisco. Adam Beam / Associated Press 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC is opening a $59 million public policy institute at its Washington, D.C. campus, a dramatic expansion of its East Coast footprint. The institute will offer evidence-based research that’ll help inform public and private policy decisions and offer students a chance to earn firsthand experience in the nation’s capital, the university said. When it opens in July, the Leonard D. Schaeffer Institute will be the first major research and education institute housed at the university’s new D.C. campus. Quinten Seghers / Daily Trojan 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] When the San Francisco 49ers take to the Super Bowl this weekend, they’ll be cheered on by an unexpected fanbase: the Trumpy, MAGA, far-right conspiracy legions. Wait, but isn’t San Francisco the shit-stained, liberal failure, fentanyl capital of the world? Well still yes, according to them, but this time they’ve managed to perplex themselves — and, frankly, everybody else — by dropping their vendetta and rooting for the Niners because they believe that Taylor Swift and her boyfriend, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, are somehow in cahoots with the NFL and the Democratic Party to win Joe Biden the election.

Tomo here: Apologies for missing yesterday’s newsletter. I was in Vegas to speak at a journalism conference and had gotten much less sleep than anticipated after the late-night flight. Salome had a migraine. Anna was just exhausted. The three of us were a bit of a mess — but we’re back now! Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the trailblazing California politician, died Thursday. She was 90. Feinstein first rose to national prominence while on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, after a disgruntled former supervisor shot and killed one of his political opponents and the city’s mayor; Feinstein was praised for her dignified leadership through the tragedy. In the Senate, Feinstein most notably fought for a 10-year assault weapons ban — a battle which she won — and forced an investigation into the CIA’s use of torture. John Wildermuth and Shira Stein / San Francisco Chronicle 2. Striking actors and Hollywood studios will meet Monday to resume contract negotiations — their first meeting in 76 days. Developments this week have been a welcome relief for an industry that has for months been mired in dual strikes; on Wednesday, striking writers left the picket line and returned to work. The actors are seeking guardrails around artificial intelligence and higher royalties from movies and television shows on streaming services. Nicole Sperling / New York Times 3. The city of Santa Monica will pay residents who live in households with multiple cars a weekly stipend to use only one. The initiative, a partnership between LA Metro and Santa Monica, is a pilot program and will pay 200 residents a stipend of up to $119.80 per week for five weeks. Other bonuses include a Metro TAP card preloaded with $50 and up to 10 free rides on Metro Bike Share. If successful in Santa Monica, Metro officials said they could roll the program out elsewhere in LA County. Jeremy Childs / Los Angeles Times 4. A federal agency is suing Tesla for allegedly harassing Black employees and subjecting them to a hostile work environment at the automaker’s Fremont factory. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission cited the use of racial slurs, epithets and stereotyping since at least 2015. The agency’s officials said they previously tried and failed to settle the suit. CEO Elon Musk has expressed a willingness to bring the case to trial. Rebecca Elliott / Wall Street Journal 5. Shasta County’s board of supervisors appointed Jon Knight — a hydroponics store owner and local far-right leader — to serve on the board of the county health agency that manages insects. Knight, of course, believes that we live in an “interesting sci-fi time” where Japanese scientists have created genetically modified mosquitoes to act as “flying syringes” and mass vaccinate populations. “This is not a conspiracy, this is a fact,” he said. The board gave the job to Knight over the county’s former public health director, who’s an epidemiologist. Dani Anguiano / The Guardian You’re all caught up.

It’s Monday, and I’m reading about a famed Bay Area bagel chain that’s coming to Los Angeles . Onto the five USC, LA and California stories you need to know for today. Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] In late 2020, a South LA doctor performed a liposuction on a 28-year-old woman in a strip mall. Less than an hour after the operation, the patient was dead. Worse: The doctor wasn’t a trained plastic surgeon. He was a pediatrician. Doctors say the incident is emblematic of a broader “Wild West” in the world of cosmetic surgery, where physicians trained in fields that have nothing to do with cosmetics are offering the complex surgeries in cash-only private practices that avoid the scrutiny of insurance companies and hospitals. Emily Alpert Reyes / Los Angeles Times 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Heavy storms collapsed a chunk of the Pacific Coast Highway in Monterey County, leaving some 2,000 motorists stranded in remote Big Sur over the weekend. By Sunday, officials started guiding the marooned tourists — who slept in inns, tents or their cars the previous night — in convoys around the damaged section of highway. It was the latest in a series of landslides that have intermittently shut down sections of the scenic highway over the last few years. “It was a crazy, weird Easter,” one tourist said. Staff / The New York Times 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Electric cars will lose their carpool lane privileges by October 2025 unless lawmakers take action. California has allowed electric, plug-in hybrid and compressed natural gas vehicles to use carpool lanes regardless of their number of passengers since 1999. But it’ll take legislation at the state and federal level to extend the program, which transportation officials say is unlikely. It’s unclear how the end of the program will affect electric vehicle sales — but it’s possible that it’ll lead to less crowded carpool lanes during rush hour. Michael Cabanatuan / San Francisco Chronicle 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Two Bay Area transit operators allegedly built themselves secret mini homes in train stations complete with kitchenettes, showers and beds. Prosecutors say the men — who face felony charges for stealing public funds to complete the unauthorized renovations — cloaked the scheme by keeping invoices under $3,000 so they could approve the payments to contractors without approval from higher-ups. “It was rather nicely done,” said the county’s district attorney. “They figured the Bay Area [commute] really is lousy.” Michael Barba / The San Francisco Standard 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC women’s basketball advanced to the “Elite Eight” quarterfinals in the NCAA tournament with a gritty win over Baylor. It was a hard-fought, 74-70 victory after two relatively painless wins earlier in the tournament. A late-game rampage by freshman phenom JuJu Watkins, who’d been lukewarm for much of the game’s early play, powered the Trojans through. The team plays UConn tonight at 6:15.

It’s Tuesday, and today is the last day to vote in the annual Fat Bear Week competition . Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Former Dodgers first baseman Steve Garvey said he’ll run as a Republican for the Senate seat formerly held by the late Dianne Feinstein. Garvey, who twice voted for former President Donald Trump, said he hopes to bring the California GOP — a historic backwater — back to relevance among state voters. The political newcomer is the highest profile Republican to enter the race so far. Seema Mehta / Los Angeles Times 2. More Californians may be placed in mental health treatment facilities against their will under new legislation signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom. The law expands the definition of who is “gravely disabled” and therefore eligible to be involuntarily institutionalized at the request of family members, now allowing for severe substance use and chronic alcoholism to be considered alongside mental illness. Supporters say the bill will help more Californians get the help they need — critics called it an erosion of civil rights. Jocelyn Wiener / CalMatters 3. San Francisco police fatally shot an unidentified driver who crashed through a wall in the Chinese consulate Monday afternoon. The shooting occurred after police made contact with the suspect, who had driven into the lobby shouting “Where is the C.C.P.,” according to bystanders. The Chinese Consulate General said the incident posed “a serious threat to the life and safety of staff and people on site” and that the embassy has the right to “pursue responsibilities related to the incident.” Nobody other than the driver was injured. Livia Albeck-Ripka and Alexandra Stevenson / The New York Times 4. A new California law signed by Gov. Newsom aims to make it easier to book high-demand campsites by penalizing last-minute cancellations with hefty fees. Interest in California’s state parks and beaches spiked after pandemic lockdowns, getting more people to appreciate the state’s natural beauty — but, at the same time, creating a massive headache at popular campsites. Many sites must be booked months ahead of time, and officials say people often cancel last minute or fail to show up, leaving many sites empty. Gregory Thomas / San Francisco Chronicle 5. A Minnesota man set the world record for “heaviest pumpkin” on Monday, winning the 50th World Championship Pumpkin Weigh-Off in Half Moon Bay. Travis Gienger, a horticulture teacher, managed to grow a 2,749-pound pumpkin — enough to make 687 pies — in his backyard. Gienger has dominated the pumpkin-growing circuit, winning three of the last four world championships. Staff / Associated Press You’re all caught up.

Tomo Chien March 22, 2024 p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Good morning. It’s Friday, and I’m reading about why Trader Joe’s employees wear those shirts . Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Three Californians sued Starbucks, alleging that the coffee chain discriminates against lactose intolerant people because it charges an extra few cents for non-dairy milk. They’re seeking $5 million because regular milk is “not a choice” for them — lest they get a stomach ache — which they say means they’re forced to pay more for higher-priced alternatives. The lactose crusaders might actually be onto something: Legal experts say their argument could hold weight because federal law recognizes lactose intolerance as a disability. Lois Beckett / The Guardian 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The family of Ryan Gainer, a 15-year-old boy with autism who was killed by San Bernardino County deputies, filed a wrongful death claim against the county — the precursor to a lawsuit. On March 9, the teenager got into an argument with his parents over household chores, which ended in him breaking glass and hitting his sister. A family member dialed 911, asking authorities to “take him in,” but later called back once Gainer calmed down to say they no longer needed help. But deputies were already enroute. When they arrived and announced themselves, Gainer panicked and strode toward the door with a gardening hoe. Deputies shot him three times, killing him. Hannah Fry and Andrew J. Campa / Los Angeles Times 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] It’s about to get a lot more expensive to own a home in parts of California. You can thank State Farm, the state’s largest home insurer, which said it’ll discontinue coverage for 72,000 homes and apartments starting this summer — leaving many of those residents with no choice but to switch to a state insurance pool, which provides minimal coverage and is far more expensive than standard insurance. The announcement came less than a year after State Farm said it wouldn’t issue any new policies in California, citing the soaring risk of wildfires and regulations that restrict insurers from raising premiums. John Woolfolk / The Mercury News 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The U.S. Justice Department sued Apple for allegedly running an illegal monopoly. The feds, along with 16 state attorneys general, say that Apple uses its dominance in the smartphone market to illegally thwart competition by refusing to support cross-platform messaging apps, blocking mobile cloud streaming services and limiting third-party wallets. Apple called the suit a “dangerous precedent” and argued that its walled garden creates “a magical experience for our users.” The tech giant is expected to face a separate sweeping probe in the European Union in the coming days. Leah Nylen / Bloomberg 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Long-shot presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr has found a puzzling ally: Alex Villanueva, the controversial former LA County sheriff. Villanueva is set to join Kennedy’s Cesar Chavez Day event in LA next weekend as the White House hopeful looks to tap into the Latino vote. It’s unclear what the men have in common other than their long history of anti-vaccine rhetoric. If anything, the scandal-plagued former sheriff might be a liability for Kennedy — Villanueva has frequently been compared to Donald Trump, is accused of letting deputy gangs run rampant under his watch and raided a county supervisor’s home in a thinly veiled political attack.

And now, here are the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. A “doomsday scenario” for the Colorado River could materialize as soon as July. If Lake Powell’s waterline drops another 38 feet, operators would be forced to shutter the Glen Canyon Dam’s turbines to avoid creating massive whirlpools in the lake, and instead direct water through much smaller bypass valves — weakening a crucial lifeline to California agriculture. Joshua Partlow / The Washington Post 2. The Los Angeles City Council banned new oil and gas wells and agreed to phase out existing ones over the next two decades, citing air quality and health concerns. The city has 780 active and 287 idle wells within its boundaries via a 2018 count. Drew Costley / Associated Press 3. Robert Luna was sworn in as LA County’s sheriff on Saturday. In the ceremony, the former Long Beach police chief pledged to commit to integrity, accountability and collaboration, bookending Alex Villanueva’s controversial tenure. Rebecca Gutierrez and Frank Stoltze / LAist 4. Stanford is under federal investigation for alleged bias against men. The investigation stems from a Title IX complaint filed by two men’s rights activists who likened women-only programs to racial segregation. Danielle Echeverria and Rachel Swan / San Francisco Chronicle 5. White nationalist Nick Fuentes got into a food fight at a Hollywood In-N-Out Burger. The racist, recently in headlines for dining with Kanye West and Donald Trump, reportedly got into an argument with a couple that then threw ketchup at him — he retaliated by hurling a Sprite that missed and hit innocent patrons.

Collin Binkley / Associated Press 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] When the Supreme Court outlawed affirmative action, experts were sure it’d mean the end of diversity at elite universities.

Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC said it’ll reinstate two scholarships that allow students to take extra classes for free, called the Academic Achievement Award and Exceptional Funding award. It’s the latest in a saga where the university cut the scholarships — in an announcement buried before the spring break, right after jacking tuition by $3,264 — then tried to compromise with thousands of angry students by allowing the programs to run for a few more years, then now seems to have completely walked back its decision. Perhaps now the university can share why tuition almost always outpaces inflation. Staff / Daily Trojan 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Mayor Karen Bass has succeeded in tackling the most visible parts of LA’s homelessness crisis. Inside Safe, her signature program, has cleared prominent encampments in places like Venice Beach and moved more than 2,100 people into temporary motel rooms. But it’s unclear whether that’ll translate to meaningful progress. Only some 400 of the program’s participants have moved into permanent housing, and about a quarter aren’t participating anymore. And, ultimately, the city can’t keep funding Inside Safe: Motel room rentals will cost the city around $110 million this fiscal year, which is unsustainable as the city looks to make budget cuts. Jill Cowan / The New York Times 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] California restaurants are scrambling to cut costs ahead of a minimum wage hike for fast-food workers that’ll take effect in April. Pizza Hut and Round Table Pizza franchisees plan to lay off some 1,280 delivery drivers. El Pollo Loco is using machines to automate its salsa making. A Cinnabon is turning down offers to expand to new locations. And McDonald’s, Chipotle and Jack in the Box said they plan to raise menu prices. “I can’t charge $20 for Happy Meals. I’m leaving no stones unturned,” said one McDonald’s operator. Heather Haddon / The Wall Street Journal 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Last year, when a Texas lawsuit threatened the nationwide availability of a popular abortion pill, California stockpiled 250,000 doses of the drug’s critical counterpart. Now, the ultra-conservative Supreme Court is finally hearing the case — but California already distributed its entire stockpile because the pills were going to expire. A spokesperson for Gov. Gavin Newsom said he’ll consult with doctors in deciding whether to purchase more pills, and that his decision could hinge on the high court’s oral arguments today: If the justices appear willing to uphold the Texas ban, California will likely resupply its stockpile. Sophia Bollag / San Francisco Chronicle 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Gov. Newsom has a big problem: He has just three months to cut $38 billion from the state’s budget. Another problem: The lawmakers helping him do that are rookies who’ve never negotiated a state budget, much less one while facing a massive shortfall. To make up for their lack of experience, lawmakers say they’re leaning on mentors and long-time aides who’ve assisted past negotiations. “This is going to be a new experience for almost everybody, including me,” said the recently appointed Assembly budget chair.

But when the new form debuted this admissions cycle, things got worse. Technical glitches locked families out. Those that did manage to submit the form may receive incorrect aid estimates. And in late January, the FAFSA had seen fewer than half of the 1.5 million applications it saw at the same time last year. “Do you have a lost class because of this?” said a college financial aid director.

Anna Betts and Lola Fadulu / The New York Times 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Seven million Californians live in flood-prone areas, but only 1 in 4 homes in those regions are covered by flood insurance — leaving thousands to repair the damage from last week’s devastating storm out of pocket. Blame lax enforcement and homeowner apathy. Flood coverage is mandatory for anybody who obtains a federally-backed mortgage for a property in a flood zone, but regulators and lenders don’t do a very good job of policing the policy. And, ultimately, it can be hard to get people to care. “People wear out hearing they’re going to die from earthquakes, fires and floods, and they get numb,” one expert said.

Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. The family of a slain LA County deputy plans to sue the sheriff’s department for putting officers at risk by making them work excessive overtime hours. The family’s attorney said Deputy Ryan Clinkunbroomer, 30, had logged 69 hours of overtime in the two weeks before he was shot and killed while waiting for a traffic light change in Palmdale in September. “Had he not been fatigued and exhausted, he would have responded safely; he’d be here today,” said his father. Christopher Weber / Associated Press 2. A fire tore through a South LA city block early Tuesday morning, leaving three hurt and 17 homeless. The blaze started at an apartment building that was under construction in Central-Alameda, and the LA Fire Department said the open-sided wooden frame helped the fire spread quickly to other properties. Arson investigators were on the scene as per city protocol, but the cause of the fire is still unknown. Staff / Los Angeles Times 3. Two Jewish groups are suing UC Berkeley and the University of California over what they called a “longstanding, unchecked spread of anti-Semitism” since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war. The suit alleges that at least 23 Berkeley Law student groups exclude members and guest speakers if they identify as Zionists or refuse to disavow Israel, and that campus leaders have failed to protect Jewish students from physical violence and threats during protests. Berkeley leaders slammed the suit as inconsistent with the First Amendment and “stunningly inaccurate.” Bianca Quilantan / Politico 4. Oakland’s city council passed a resolution calling for a cease-fire in Gaza after hours of impassioned rhetoric Monday evening. The council shot down an amendment that would’ve specifically condemned killings and hostage-taking by Hamas, to the boos of the packed chamber. “It raises an interesting question on where they are getting this mandate to speak for the people in their city when nobody elected a city council person because of their stance on Middle East peace,” one expert said. Olga R. Rodriguez and Robert Jablon / Associated Press 5. A San Francisco nonprofit is looking to give elected officials and political candidates “Asian scores” to rate their performance on issues it claims Asians prioritize — like public safety and education. Volunteers will vote “basically colorblind” on legislation and voting track records to determine the scores. Because, of course, Asians all care about the same things. And should all vote the same way. Asians are a monolith. Han Li / The San Francisco Standard You’re all caught up. Thanks for reading Morning, Trojan, and have a good day.

The program offered qualifying households $30 per month for internet service and one-time subsidies for laptops, desktop computers and tablets: a lifeline for low-income families whose children need internet access to complete their school work. But congressional funding has dried up — and 22 million households across the U.S. are now left hanging. Caitlin Roehmholdt / Daily Trojan 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] California has the second-highest unemployment rate in the U.S., thanks in part to tech layoffs, Hollywood strikes and agricultural woes. Experts say that high unemployment in California isn’t atypical given its young workforce, but the state’s shrinking job market over the last six months is cause for concern. The state sports a 5.1% unemployment rate compared to the national average of 3.7%, though Southern California has borne the brunt of it — the Hollywood strikes led to job losses not only in the entertainment industry, but also restaurants and small businesses that rely on those workers. Kurtis Lee / The New York Times 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Elon Musk sued OpenAI, alleging the San Francisco-based company is violating its mission by putting profit ahead of humanity. Musk, who co-founded the company but is no longer involved, said the AI giant’s close relationship with Microsoft is leading it astray from its original mission of creating open-source technology free of corporate influence. The suit, which claims breach of contract, asks among other things that OpenAI release its technology and research to the public. Musk has long raised concerns about AI safety, though it should be noted that the billionaire is also raising money for his own competing AI startup. Saritha Rai / Bloomberg 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Say goodbye to the fried chicken joint Honeybird, which will close its doors in the USC Village on Saturday thanks to sluggish sales. Students, for their part, don’t seem particularly upset. There seems to be a strong consensus that a Raising Cane’s should replace the joint, though the chances of that happening — as opposed to another high-priced, mediocre restaurant rotating in — seem abysmal. “I’m not really gaining or losing anything, and the couple of times I’ve eaten there, it’s just been okay,” one student said. Ian Maile and Marco Haynes / Annenberg Media 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] LA’s hottest new celebrity spot is a drab West Hollywood strip mall. Bad Bunny, Selena Gomez, Kendall Jenner and Beyoncé have all been spotted at the mall’s nondescript sushi restaurant, a boon for the business that’s now been featured in high-fashion photoshoots and whose owner was invited to run a pop-up at a Paris fashion house. It’s all ultimately a calculated ploy at relatability, though. It’s a spot where celebrities know they won’t have to call the paparazzi on themselves.

Still, the 89-year-old San Franciscan pushed back against calls for her to resign altogether. Mariana Alfaro and Liz Goodwin / The Washington Post 2. Two former employees of Kenneth Mejia, the newly elected LA city controller, alleged that the politician created an uncomfortable work environment by frequently commenting on the sex lives of campaign workers and pressing staffers to move into his apartment complex. Mejia denied the allegations and said the first he heard of the issues was when staffers posted about them on social media this week. Julia Wick / Los Angeles Times 3. California is among several states who reached a $462 million settlement with Juul Labs, resolving lawsuits that alleged Juul failed to warn young customers about the high levels of addictive nicotine in its e-cigarettes. The company’s efforts to broker deals over lawsuits have cost an estimated $3 billion thus far. Christina Jewett and Julie Creswell / The New York Times 4. LA Police Chief Michel Moore said last month’s accidental release of photos identifying the department’s undercover agents hasn’t significantly affected any covert operations. Rank-and-file officers — who are suing the city for negligence in failing to redact the photos in a public records release — said Moore was downplaying the leak’s effects. Josh Cain / Los Angeles Daily News 5. The LA City Council approved an ordinance allowing police to arrest anyone possessing a catalytic converter not attached to a vehicle in an effort to tamp down on rampant theft of the car part.

Feinstein was San Francisco’s first female mayor and the longest-serving female senator in U.S. history. Marisa Kendall / Mercury News 2. USC will distribute free Naloxone — an opioid reversal drug — every Wednesday through April 5 at the farmer’s market in McCarthy Quad. The program is part of a nation-wide effort to tamp down on the fentanyl crisis, which the university’s chief health officer said has led to a “small” number of student overdoses. Claire Qiu / Daily Trojan 3. California’s population dropped by more than half a million people between April 2020 and July 2022, a decrease second only to New York. Experts pointed to high housing costs, the rise of remote work, crime and pollution in large urban centers. Terry Castleman / Los Angeles Times 4. A proposed San Francisco policy would void the city’s sanctuary laws for immigrants convicted of selling fentanyl, potentially opening the door to their deportation.

Corporate America has increasingly retreated from diversity promises made in the wake of George Floyd’s death in 2020, particularly as conservatives mount a growing legal, political and cultural effort against such efforts. Taylor Telford / The Washington Post 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Republican Steve Garvey sits at second place in the race for California’s U.S. Senate seat, according to the latest polling. It’s a rather remarkable feat, mostly Garvey doesn’t even seem to be trying. He has next to no substantive policy proposals. He barely campaigns. And he tends to play the role of punching bag in debates with his Democratic rivals. Thank Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff, the race’s frontrunner, for Garvey’s success. In California, the top two primary candidates regardless of party advance to the general election: So Schiff has run attack ads that depict Garvey as his main opponent in a successful effort to boost his rival’s stature.

Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. A fire Saturday morning caused “extensive damage” to the Interstate 10 and indefinitely shut down the freeway near Alameda Street. Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency to help repair the notoriously congested roadway, but officials said they have no estimate for when repairs will be complete. The shutdown, in the meantime, is expected to cause “a significant traffic impact.” No injuries were reported in the fire, which started in a storage yard under the freeway. Staff / CNN 2. California schools are now required to teach students how to recognize fake news. The requirement, part of an assembly bill signed by Gov. Newsom last month, instructs schools to weave media literacy curriculum into existing courses rather than create a standalone class. A recent survey found that young adults are almost as likely to believe information on social media as they are from a national news outlet; the bill’s advocates hope to change that. Carolyn Jones / CalMatters 3. Unsealed surveillance footage from LA County jails showed guards repeatedly punching a handcuffed inmate even after he fell to the ground; heaving a man headfirst into a wall; and kneeling on a man’s neck for nearly a minute. Advocates say the videos — released at the request of two news organizations — reveal a culture of violence in the jail system that has persisted even with state and federal oversight. The sheriff’s department contended that the videos depict a few isolated incidents that aren’t representative of most interactions. Keri Blakinger and Maria L. La Ganga / Los Angeles Times 4. The contractor who died at the Hub LA Figueroa apartments last month was electrocuted when he “made contact with an electrical source” in the ceiling, according to the LA Fire Department. The man died on site, and the U.S. Department of Labor is still investigating the incident. Separately, last week, the embattled apartment said it was pushing its move-in date back for a fourth time to Nov. 16, citing paperwork issues. Kate Stuzin / Annenberg Media 5. A video of a pro-Palestinian protest at UCLA went viral over the weekend, showing students shouting “beat that f——- Jew” while hitting a piñata bearing the image of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The school’s chancellor condemned the incident as “hateful” and “despicable,” but noted that the rhetoric is still protected speech under the First Amendment.

Yesterday, we wrote about a large brawl in a Torrance mall involving dozens of juveniles — and how similar fights broke out in movie theaters across the country. Officials say those fights were likely linked to steeply discounted ticket prices offered on National Cinema Day, which was Sunday. Similar fights broke out last year. We find the explanation pretty depressing, because it essentially means that any large group of youths in public spaces are prone to stab each other and put police officers in chokeholds . Now, onto the five (other) USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. California’s wildland firefighters are being exposed to increasingly dangerous levels of smoke and pollutants as fire seasons grow longer and more intense. Many believe that’s causing them to contract — and ultimately die from — serious diseases like cancer. State and federal fire officials have done little to secure better protections for their workers on the fire line, and in fact only recently began testing respirators specifically designed for backcountry firefighting. Julie Johnson / San Francisco Chronicle 2. Mark Ridley Thomas, the disgraced former LA politician, was sentenced to three and a half years in federal prison and a $30,000 fine Monday for seven felony corruption charges. While on the county Board of Supervisors, Ridley-Thomas supported a county contract favorable to USC in exchange for a full scholarship and faculty job for his son. He also funneled money from one of his political funds through USC to a fund operated by his son. Frank Stoltze / LAist 3. State Sen. Mike McGuire was elected as the next leader of the California Senate, succeeding Senate Pro Tem Toni Atkins — the first woman and openly gay lawmaker to hold the post — who terms out next year. McGuire, a moderate Democrat who hails from the North Coast, positioned himself as a bridge between an outgoing class of veteran legislators and a wave of newer members. Staff / Politico 4. A jury awarded the mother of a man killed by LA Police Department officers in 2017 more than $23 million Friday. Jurors found that the officers used negligent and excessive force when they shot and killed Jesse Murillo, a 32-year-old navy veteran. The LA County District Attorney’s Office previously declined to file charges against the officers, contending they had reason to believe Murillo was running toward them with a weapon. Josh Cain / Los Angeles Daily News 5. California Attorney General Rob Bonta sued the Chino Valley Unified School District in a bid to halt a new requirement that forces school staff to notify parents when their child asks to use a name or pronouns that differ from what’s on their birth certificate. Bonta, who called the policy a “forced outing” of transgender students, is also seeking to stop three other districts looking to follow Chino Valley’s example.

Share this with a friend 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Officials said firefighters have slowed the massive Palisades and Eaton blazes as this week’s dangerous winds begin to die down. The Eaton fire is 55% contained and the Palisades is 22%. Still, it may be a short reprieve. Forecasters warned that dry conditions and renewed winds could once again bring fire weather next week. Staff / NBC Los Angeles 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Wildfire evacuees say they’re growing increasingly frustrated that they can’t return to their homes even after fires have passed through their neighborhoods. Some want to sleep in their own beds. Others want to see if their homes have burned down. Officials haven’t said when they’ll lift evacuation orders. Staff / Los Angeles Times 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Two USC film students could earn the chance to air a Super Bowl commercial — and win $1 million.

Here are the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. At least five people were injured in a shooting at San Pedro beach Saturday night. Authorities said some remained hospitalized in critical condition. The suspect is believed to have used a semi-automatic handgun and fled the scene in a gray sedan, though no arrests have been made. Hailey Branson-Potts / Los Angeles Times 2. Student activists are pushing the University of California system to allow students who are undocumented and ineligible for a work permit to get jobs on campus. The UC Regents appeared open to making such a change, though attempting to do so could make for an uphill battle in the courts. Adolfo Guzman-Lopez / LAist 3. Forecasts show that yet another atmospheric river could hit Northern California by the end of the week, though it won’t be as strong as January’s storms. Experts cautioned that the rain could melt parts of the Sierra snowpack — which is at its highest level in a century for the start of March — and result in downstream flooding. Jessica Flores / San Francisco Chronicle 4. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis paid Southern California a visit this weekend in what appeared to be a campaign-like donor swing. In a statement, Gov. Gavin Newsom sardonically welcomed the likely presidential candidate to the “real freedom state,” not to be outdone by the “Ron DeFascist” graffiti that Simi Valley authorities had to scrub off the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library’s entrance sign. Nicholas Kerr / ABC News 5. A Huntington Beach man earned the Guinness World Record for most consecutive visits to Disneyland. Jeff Reitz, 50, visited the Anaheim theme park every day for eight years, three months and 13 days: a streak that began while he was unemployed and gifted an annual pass to the park.

A 5-year-old boy was swept away by floodwaters in San Luis Obispo County while swamped streets left people trapped in their cars in LA. Staff / Los Angeles Times 2. The LA Police Commission will soon decide whether to reappoint Chief Michel Moore to a second term. Moore has said he’d only serve two or three years of the five-year term in order to build a succession plan and help prepare for the 2028 Summer Olympics. Frank Stoltze / LAist 3. Gov. Gavin Newsom is expected to unveil a tight budget plan Tuesday that’ll cover the multi-billion dollar deficit the state is staring down. The shortfall is a remarkable turn of fortune for California, which has benefited from a booming tech industry for the better part of the last decade. Adam Beam / Associated Press 4. Georgia put on a dominating performance over TCU at Inglewood’s SoFi Stadium to secure the College Football Playoff title, making a strong case that the Bulldogs have established the next college football dynasty. Georgia set a new record for most points scored in a championship game, and the 65-7 victory made for the most lopsided margin in a national title game in college history. Adam Grosbard / Los Angeles Daily News 5. It’s a La Niña year. So why is it this rainy? During La Niña, trade winds move warm water toward the coast of Asia which typically makes for drier weather in California (as opposed to the more famously wet El Niño). But La Niña essentially loads the dice in favor of a dry season, rather than guaranteeing it — which is why you’ll be walking to class in the miserable rain today.

Send your friends here 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Electric air taxis are coming to USC — supposedly. A company called Archer Aviation says it plans to build an ambitious network of “vertiports” across LA by 2026, including a station at USC. The company has not said how much flights will cost. But if it’s any consolation, Archer’s promo videos feature a very handsome, very leather-clad Usher . Bruce Haring / Deadline 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC was ranked the fifth-best party school in the U.S. in Niche’s latest rankings , up from sixth-best last year . UC Santa Barbara, unsurprisingly, nabbed the top spot. “Its all on the row,” one student reviewer wrote of USC. “And thats just annoying cause its all about hooking up.” Tomoki Chien / Morning, Trojan 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] There’s a wild battle raging over the future of a male stripping empire. Steve Banerjee, the disgraced founder of the originally LA-based Chippendales, forfeited his interest in the company after he hired a hit man to take out a former employee. Now, his son is claiming he’s the heir to the enterprise — and that the company tried to assassinate him. Brittny Mejia / Los Angeles Times 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Pete Carroll, the legendary USC football coach who later won a Super Bowl, is returning to campus … to teach a class. The university said it’ll be in the spring, but did not offer more specifics. Read more about Carroll in one of the best profiles ever written . Greg Beacham / Associated Press 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A USC study found that people who consume excessive amounts of weed are up to five times as likely to develop head and neck cancer than those who don’t.

She added that the university plans to comply with the law.

Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC President Carol Folt is the fourth-highest-paid private college president in the country, earning a cool $3.5 million in 2021. That’s around $1.4 million base, $900,000 in bonuses, $1.1 million in “other” and $20,000 in benefits. In the past few decades, compensation for top university leaders has skyrocketed: Between 2009 and 2019, pay for university presidents grew by 23% adjusted for inflation. Lincoln Riley , by the way, reportedly makes around $10 million a year, so Folt is by no means the highest paid on USC payroll. Not that I’d mind a job with a six-figure bonus. Maddie Aiken / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The fire earlier this week at Cowlings and Ilium Residential College was caused by a bag of potato chips that students left in an oven. USC officials said the fire was contained to the oven and ultimately extinguished by Department of Public Safety personnel. An email yesterday reminded residents not to store things in their ovens — lest students have to exercise common sense without being told to do so. Henry Kofman and Jennifer Nehrer / Daily Trojan 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] LA County is suing GrubHub, alleging the food delivery service falsely advertises prices it later inflates with surprise fees at the checkout tab. For instance, a sandwich at one local deli is listed as starting at $17 but ultimately goes for more than $26 with additional fees and sales tax — and that’s not counting the tip. It’s the latest government attempt to protect consumers from such “junk fees”: A new state law will go into effect this summer prohibiting last-minute fees from a long list of businesses, including food delivery apps. Rebecca Ellis / Los Angeles Times 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Ever dreamed of riding a gondola from Union Station to Dodger Stadium? If you have, I’ve got great news: A project to do just that cleared its first hurdle when the Metro’s board unanimously approved the 1.2-mile aerial tramway’s environmental analysis. Are you a Chinatown resident who’s not stoked by the idea of a gondola running through your backyard? If so, I’ve also got great news: All Chinatown residents would get free rides on the gondola. Because free rides will make it all better. Right? Makenna Sievertson / LAist 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] In 1949, In-N-Out invented the drive-thru. Before that, fast food chains used the inefficient drive-in system where customers parked and ordered from roller-skating carhops. But one day, Harry Snyder, In-N-Out’s founder, mounted a two-way speaker on a post at his Baldwin Park location — and the modern drive-thru was born. Wendy’s and Burger King didn’t adopt the technology until the 1960s and McDonald’s waited until the mid-1970s, which gave In-N-Out a competitive advantage for nearly two decades. “The drive-thru window really formalized what fast food is all about,” said an author who wrote a book about fast food.

Carson Dorais, Ben Cohen and Lorenzo Arce / Annenberg Media 2. Canvassers working on behalf of oil companies are blatantly lying to Californians, asking them to sign a petition that they say will ban new oil wells near homes and schools — when in fact the petition is meant to do the exact opposite: Put the landmark ban on hold.

Share this with a friend 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC researchers linked “forever chemicals” in products like nonstick pans and shampoos to poor sleep.

It’s Tuesday, and I hope you enjoyed your long weekend. I’m reading about how Los Angeles County is home to 5,484 Mexican restaurants , the most of any U.S. county. Onto the five USC, LA and California stories you need to know for today. 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Former LA County Sheriff Alex Villanueva delivered a bizarre testimony before an oversight committee about deputy gangs — violent groups of deputies known to valorize civilian shootings and subvert the chain of command. For one, Villanueva insisted that the hearing was a “witch hunt” and repeatedly denied that violent gangs are a problem in the department; he said the gangs are benign groups like the department’s softball teams. Villanueva frequently criticized the committee’s questions, calling one “about the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard” and likening another to asking “When did you stop beating your wife?” Tim Dickinson / Rolling Stone 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A key analyst said that Gov. Gavin Newsom vastly underestimated the state’s budget deficit when he presented his spending plan for the coming fiscal year, and that his proposed budget has its “strengths and weaknesses.” The Legislature’s nonpartisan analyst office put the deficit at $58 billion as opposed to Newsom’s $38 billion, and argued that Newsom should cut more short-term programs rather than dip so far into reserves. The real trouble, though, might be where the two agree: Both predict deficits of up to $30 billion through 2027. Mikhail Zinshteyn / CalMatters 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] LA Police Chief Michel Moore will retire at the end of February, ending a nearly six-year tenure that saw notable reforms in the wake of George Floyd’s death — but also more than his share of scandals. Under Moore’s tenure, a botched bomb squad operation leveled a South LA neighborhood; a department captain leaked details in a sex crime investigation to the case’s alleged perpetrator; and the city paid $4 million in damages to a female commander after her colleagues circulated a nude photo doctored to look like her. Moore’s backers, though, say his department embraced progressive reforms like limiting pretextual traffic stops and expanding community outreach efforts. Staff / Los Angeles Times 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] California lawmakers will decide this month whether to ban tackle football for kids under 12, and the debate is already contentious. Medical experts say the sport seriously increases the risk of brain trauma, which can lead to poor impulse control and thinking problems. Critics argue that banning tackle football could end an outlet for youths who might otherwise find themselves in gangs, and that lawmakers are making no effort to ban lacrosse and ice hockey — sports with similar concussion rates played mostly in affluent communities. Ryan Sabalow / CalMatters 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC women’s basketball beat UCLA 73-65 on Sunday, ending a nine-game losing streak to the Bruins and avenging their only loss of the season. Star freshman JuJu Watkins led the No. 9 Trojans with 32 points. The real story, though, might’ve been off the court: The Trojans played Sunday in front of a standing-room-only crowd that set the team’s new venue attendance record, a remarkable change of fortune from just a few years ago when, as coach Lindsay Gottlieb put it, nobody attended women’s games. “I’ll never forget this,” Gottlieb said.

We’re watching this video of Yellowstone wolves bringing “toys” back to their pups. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Former USC running back Reggie Bush will file a defamation lawsuit against the NCAA over a spokesperson’s 2021 claim that the two-time All American was involved in a “pay-for-play” scheme during his college tenure. In 2010, Bush’s Heisman Trophy was vacated after an NCAA investigation found he and his family received impermissible benefits, like cash, from USC. Bush sought to have his records restored amid new name, image and likeness rules in 2021, prompting the NCAA spokesperson’s claim. Adam Silverstein / CBS 2. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration has vehemently opposed a bipartisan state bill that would slow the rollout of self-driving trucks on California roadways. The bill, Newsom contends, would stifle innovation and encourage valuable companies to relocate to more lenient states. Supporters argue that autonomous big rigs would throw the trucking industry into chaos and that the technology isn’t ready for the roadways. Jeremy B. White / Politico 3. Police arrested two counterprotesters at a demonstration opposing LGBTQ+ education Monday in downtown LA. The march — whose demonstrators from across Southern California demanded that discussions of the LGBTQ+ community and sex education be kept out of schools — was the latest in a pattern of recent clashes over gender and race education in conservative regions of California. Howard Blume / Los Angeles Times 4. A California bill could soon permanently ban watering grass lawns at businesses and public use properties — like office parks, strip malls, universities and road medians. It wouldn’t apply to homes, apartments, cemeteries or “functional turf” like sports fields and playgrounds. The bill soared through the Assembly in May and is now moving through the Senate. Paul Rogers / The Mercury News 5. Tropical Storm Hilary is expected to help delay the fire season in the chaparral and coastal regions that surround many Southern California cities — with a caveat. Once wind speeds begin to pick up, the extra moisture may mean little as dry gusts sweep embers for miles. Regardless, officials say the chances of a large fire in the Sierras are extremely low this year because of the winter’s heavy snowfall. Jacob Margolis / LAist You’re all caught up.

( Vanessa Romo / NPR ) 🚨 In case you missed it The southern section of the California Interscholastic Federation voted to make girls flag football an official fall sport, paving the way for the broader state federation to do the same in February. The federation will do a first read on the proposal next week. ( Tarek Fattal / Daily News ) Forward this email to a friend who might enjoy! Click here to subscribe.

Seven stories for today, Sept. 28 📰 Editor’s note Before we get into today’s news, I’m thrilled to share that we’re now joined by Chris Bibona in a new daily segment called “The Sports Corner.” Chris is a colleague at Annenberg Media and the Daily Trojan who I have a lot of respect for — a strong writer, and a good dude in general. I’m sure we’ll be making tweaks to The Sports Corner’s format as time goes on, but know that we’re on the verge of some pretty cool changes to the newsletter. Welcome, Chris! 📍 On campus The Undergraduate Student Government is offering a free shuttle from USC to LAX over the fall recess. The estimated travel time is 30 minutes. ( Undergraduate Student Government ) A petition circulated by USC students called for the university to expand its racial and ethnic categories to include Middle Eastern and North African students on its admission application. ( Thomas Schmidt / Daily Trojan ) 🌴 In L.A. UCLA made its largest land acquisition in history, purchasing 35 acres from the now-defunct Marymount California University in an effort to ease its housing crisis and make room for future expansion. ( Tyler Shaun Evains and Lisa Jacobs / Daily Breeze ) Authorities arrested a Lancaster man on suspicion of beating a veteran L.A. County deputy to death in her home. The motive was unclear as of Tuesday. ( City News Service ) An athletic trainer who worked at two San Fernando Valley high schools was charged with sex-related counts against 10 teenage girls. Over the last five years, Richard Alexander Turner, 64, allegedly assaulted girls between the ages of 15 and 17 who sought recovery from sports injuries. ( City News Service ) 🌅 California A federal appellate court ruled that a California law banning private prisons and detention facilities violates the U.S. Constitution when applied to facilities operated on behalf of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ( Kevin Rector / Los Angeles Times ) Gov. Gavin Newson signed a package of bills that establish some of the strongest abortion protections in the nation, further positioning California as a “safe haven” for reproductive health. California voters will decide in November whether to add an amendment codifying the right to obtain an abortion in the state constitution. ( Kristen Hwang / CalMatters ) 🏆 The Sports Corner with Chris Bibona Mens water polo (10-4) finished in fourth place at the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Invitational at Stanford this weekend. The Trojans were on the verge of a rankings-shattering upset versus No. 1 UC Berkeley on Sunday, but ultimately fell to the Golden Bears 11-10 in regulation. USC still managed a 17-8 win against Fordham on Friday and a 11-9 victory against UC Davis on Saturday before falling to UCLA 13-12 later that night. No doubt a pair of one-point losses will leave a bad taste in the mouth of the Trojans, but an opportunity for revenge will come on Oct. 15 at Cal, and in the regular season finale at UCLA on Nov. 11. Mens basketball gathered for its first official practice on Monday , just about six months after a first-round loss to the University of Miami in the 2022 NCAA Tournament. The Trojans are bent on avenging their premature March Madness exit, but an early season schedule consisting of playoff perennials like Kansas, Tennessee and Wisconsin — along with the usual Pac-12 adversaries — will force USC to put its money where its mouth is. The team this year is reinforced with a fresh batch of highly ranked recruits, but what I think makes this squad so dangerous is its veteran core, led by veteran backcourt tandem Boogie Ellis and Drew Peterson. Senior offensive lineman Brett Neilon quickly became a program icon with his heroic act dubbed the “Neilon Nudge” — reminiscent of the “Bush Push” — in USC’s 17-14 win over Oregon State on Saturday. Also in football, make sure to check out this profile piece on backup quarterback Jake Jensen which traverses his complicated journey to USC. In the world of pro sports… The Dodgers clinched home field advantage in the National League playoff bracket, and are all but imminent to clinch home field in the World Series. The Boys In Blue ( who lost last night 3-2 to the Padres in extra innings) are a win away from setting a new franchise record of 107 wins in the regular season — and just 10 shy of the all-time record of 116 held by both the 2001 Mariners and the 1906 Cubs. Other scores around the LA professional sports scene: The Rams defeated the Cardinals 20-12, and the Chargers suffered an embarrassing 38-10 loss to the Jaguars on Sunday. I’m still really high on the Chargers, but maybe even higher on the new-look Jaguars. Was Urban Meyer really that bad, or is Doug Peterson just the answer to Duval County’s prayers? ⭐️ A bonus Check out this quick midterm “survival guide” that lists some of the best campus study spots from Haylee Clophus and Christian Borden at Annenberg Media. 🚨 In case you missed it A UC system housing crisis has forced campuses to pack dorm halls and reject thousands of student housing applications, leading some to live in recreational vehicles or take on multiple jobs and loans to make rent.

It’s Thursday, and I’m looking at a theoretical map that divides the U.S. into states of equal population size. Spoiler: California is split into, like, seven. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A fungal disease called Valley fever could be on the rise in California thanks to extreme storm events. Valley fever is caused by inhaling the spores of a fungus called Coccidioides that thrives in long periods of drought after extremely wet conditions. Roughly 6 in 10 people don’t display symptoms of the disease, but those that do often experience fevers, coughs and headaches, sometimes progressing to more serious conditions like pneumonia — or death, in extremely rare cases. State health officials said they tallied a record 9,280 new cases of the disease last year and expect an “increased risk” in 2024. Zoya Teirstein / Grist 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Don’t plan to go on any late-night ocean drives this week. Caltrans will shut down all lanes of a section of the Pacific Coast Highway in south Ventura County at 6 p.m. daily until further notice. Crews are working to repair erosion on the oceanside shoulder, and the highway should reopen around 7 a.m. — depending on when a state inspector deems the road safe to reopen. Officials said the closures are a safety precaution because conditions can change overnight in reduced visibility. Chris Lindahl / Patch 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Last week, Gov. Gavin Newsom earned headlines when he announced a plan to deploy 120 highway patrol officers to stymie rising crime in Oakland. Five days later, the operation is over, and local officials said they’re surprised at how quickly it ended. The short deployment did lead to 71 arrests and the recovery of 145 stolen vehicles, and Newsom said that more “surge operations” are to come — but it wasn’t clear when and how those will happen, and Newsom said those won’t be publicized. Jakob Rodgers and Rick Hurd / The Mercury News 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Candidates running for president of USC’s Undergraduate Student Government sparred over Greek life in Tuesday night’s debate. The four tickets were somewhat split: One candidate claimed Greek life “institutionally is having people get sexually assaulted, get hazed” while others called for USG to work with the governing bodies of fraternities and sororities. The question, of course, is how much of a difference the student government can actually make — and whether undergraduate voters care. Last year’s election saw just a 19.5% turnout. Voting runs Feb. 20-23 this year. Nicholas Corral / Daily Trojan 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Tech millionaires are pouring money into San Francisco elections this year, hoping to boost moderate candidates and ballot measures as Californians grow increasingly wary of drugs, crime and homelessness. The Silicon Valley donors say the city has swung too far left on the political spectrum and that progressive policies have been too soft on crime and too “woke” on issues like public education. One city supervisor targeted by the techies called the influx of money a “cynical effort to control the city” and a blatant attempt to “buy political power and reshape the rules for their own economic benefit.” Preetika Rana / The Wall Street Journal"},{"slug":"garcetti-pushes-for-ambassadorship-colorado-springs-shooting-trojans-down-ucla","title":"Garcetti pushes for ambassadorship; Colorado Springs shooting; Trojans down UCLA","date":1669045560000,"web_exclusive":false,"content":"*|MC_PREVIEW_TEXT|* View this email in your browser By Tomoki Chien NEWSLETTER EDITOR Good morning, and what a weekend. My colleagues at the Daily Trojan soundly lost to the Daily Bruin in our annual flag football game, but I’m pleased to share that the precedent is supposedly that if the Daily Trojan loses, the (real) Trojans win. I guess we were just doing our part, really. And now, here are the seven USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today — plus five from the nation and world. 1. Nearly half of the 15-person LA City Council will be new members when they’re sworn in next month. Six will be women — the most in council history — and the slate of council members as a whole has shaped up to be particularly ideologically diverse. Josie Huang / LAist 2. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, who who leaves office in less than a month, is pushing hard for the U.S. Senate to confirm his appointment as ambassador to India. But doubts over whether Garcetti mishandled sexual harassment allegations against a top aide have made for a fraught 16-month campaign since President Joe Biden tapped the mayor for the job. James Rainey and Dakota Smith / Los Angeles Times 3. One of six people hospitalized in a September gang-related shooting on an Oakland high school campus died Thursday. David Sakurai, 64, was a school district carpenter. Harry Harris / East Bay Times 4. California’s 2024 Senate race could be “a real free-for-all” if Dianne Feinstein, the oldest sitting U.S. Senator, retires as many expect. Representatives Adam Schiff of Burbank and Katie Porter of Irvine could both make credible runs; and don’t count out proven statewide candidates like Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis and Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta — or any of the big city mayors and even LA County supervisors, for that matter. Phil Willon / Los Angeles Times 5. An LA County sheriff’s cadet is in “grave condition” after an SUV plowed into a morning training run last week. Three other trainees remain hospitalized in critical condition. City News Service 6. Rep. Karen Bass said her first priority upon taking up the LA mayoral office next month will be to declare a state of emergency over homelessness — and to tap into local, state and federal funds to expand assistance and build housing. Alexander Nieves / Politico 7. San Francisco launched a guaranteed income program for transgender residents. The program, which is accepting applications until Dec. 15, will provide 55 residents with $1,200 per month for up to 18 months alongside medical, mental health and financial coaching services. Olivia Cruz Mayeda / The San Francisco Standard Nation / world By Anna Hsu CONTRIBUTOR Patrons at a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs ended a gunman’s rampage by hitting him with his own gun after he killed five people in what is being investigated as a hate crime. ( Los Angeles Times ) A series of videos circulating online has prompted questions over whether Ukrainian soldiers committed war crimes in an encounter with Russian soldiers. ( The New York Times ) Robert Iger will again lead Walt Disney Co. as CEO after leaving the role last year, replacing Bob Chapek as the company reports big losses in its streaming service despite a rebound in theme park business. ( The Wall Street Journal ) Physicians in states with abortion restrictions are grappling with the legality of abortions under medical emergencies in a post-Roe world. ( Associated Press ) Representatives at the COP27 summit have struck a deal for richer nations to compensate developing countries for damages and economic losses resulting from climate change. ( BBC ) Sports By Chris Bibona CONTRIBUTOR Mark J. Terrill / Associated Press It was the game of the year for USC — and the game of sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams’ life. The Trojans marched into the Rose Bowl Saturday and defeated UCLA 48-45 behind 503 scrimmage yards and 3 total touchdowns from their phenom QB. USC darted up to No. 5 on the AP Poll Sunday and clinched a trip to Las Vegas for the Pac-12 Championship game — to be played against one of three teams; Utah, Washington or Oregon, with the Ducks being the most likely. If Oregon wins, it’s in. USC will play No. 13 Notre Dame on Saturday, Nov. 26 at the Coliseum. USC swept the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Men’s Water Polo Championship over the weekend. A hilarious 30-3 win against Austin College Friday set up a much-needed 12-11 redemption victory against UCLA Saturday. In the West Championship, the Trojans outgunned Stanford 14-10 on Sunday — effectively clinching a spot in the 2022 NCAA Tournament. USC’s 18th straight tournament bid begins Dec. 1, but the team’s quarterfinal matchup is still TBA. Women’s volleyball began a three-game road trip across the Pacific Northwest with a straight-set victory over Oregon State on Friday. Freshman outside hitter Jordan Wilson led the floor with 12 kills, while graduate middle blocker Kalyah Williams supplied the defense with 5 blocks in the contest. On Sunday, USC fell to Oregon 3-2 despite 27 kills from senior outside hitter Skylar Fields. The Women of Troy play the University of Washington on Wednesday at 5:30 p.m. Tomoki Chien / Daily Trojan Men’s basketball won its third game in a row after an 83-74 victory over Mount St. Mary’s on Friday. Senior guard Boogie Ellis led the Trojans with 19 points, while fifth-year guard Drew Peterson scored 15 points, grabbed 8 rebounds and dished 12 assists. The Trojans will pack some swim trunks along with their usual gear as they head out to the Bahamas for the Battle 4 Atlantis. The three-day tournament begins with a Wednesday matchup against BYU on Paradise Island.

Pelosi, who will remain a rank-and-file representative, said the attack on her husband in the couple’s San Francisco home played a major role in her decision to step down. Marianna Sotomayor and Paul Kane / The Washington Post The University of California Board of Regents punted a decision to block UCLA’s Pac-12 defection to Dec. 14. Critics of the school’s move to the Big Ten Conference have cited increased travel time and cost, along with millions in lost revenue for UC Berkeley — which would suffer from a less lucrative TV contract if its LA counterpart flees the conference.

The man who broke into the Pelosi’s San Francisco home intended to hold the house speaker hostage and break “her kneecaps.” Federal prosecutors filed charges against the assailant, David DePape, revealing new details about the attack on Monday. Megan Cassidy / San Francisco Chronicle 2. Some towns in northern California’s wine country are banning the construction of new gas stations. Local leaders say the laws are part of an effort to fight climate change as more residents are switching to electric vehicles; opponents say the bans will raise prices and force residents to drive farther for gas. Zusha Elinson / The Wall Street Journal 3. In related news: Mom-and-pop gas station owners worry that California’s 2035 gas car phaseout means the end of their businesses. Installing electric vehicle chargers can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars that only larger chains can afford, effectively spelling the end for the smaller stations once the used gas car market fades away in the coming decades. Daniel Miller / Los Angeles Times 4. The Hoopa Valley Tribe sued the federal government for allegedly violating its sovereignty and failing to collect money from California farms that rely on federally supplied water to pay for damages to tribal fisheries. The tribe has a reservation in northwest California. Kathleen Ronayne / Associated Press 5. A UC Irvine study found that a catastrophic flood in Los Angeles would cause far greater damage to life and property than federal emergency officials have forecast in the past. The study also found that Black Angelenos would be 79% more likely to experience waist-high flooding than white Angelenos. Louis Sahagún and Sean Greene / Los Angeles Times 6. A carbon dioxide leak at Los Angeles International Airport sickened four workers, one of whom was in “critical condition.” The leak occurred in a small utility room some 200 feet from the Terminal 8 baggage area. Tony Kurzweil / KTLA 7. California public universities have been barred from race-conscious admissions since 1996. As the Supreme Court appears poised to strike down affirmative action, universities across the nation might look to lessons learned from the alternative routes to diversity that the University of California and California State University systems have experimented with. Adolfo Guzman-Lopez / LAist Nation / world In opening arguments, the Supreme Court’s six conservative justices posited that race-based admissions violate the Constitution’s guarantee of “equal protection,” possibly signaling an end to affirmative action in American universities. ( Los Angeles Times ) A judge blocked Penguin Random House’s $2.18 billion acquisition of Simon &amp; Schuster Inc., arguing that the merger would “lessen” competition. ( Bloomberg ) President Joe Biden called on oil and gas companies to lower costs as they gain large profits — or otherwise face a big hike in taxes.

Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. George Tyndall, the former USC gynecologist accused of sexually abusing hundreds of patients over a seven-year span, was found dead in his home Thursday. His lawyer said there’s no evidence of foul play or suicide. Tyndall was expected to face a criminal trial after a civil suit in which USC agreed to an $852 million settlement with more than 700 women who accused Tyndall of abuse — believed to be a record sum for a settlement of its kind. Stefanie Dazio / Associated Press 2. One in three board members at California public universities have direct ties to the fossil fuel industry, according to a new analysis from a climate research group. Critics say those board members can informally set funding priorities and set research goals, and that the effects aren’t limited to college campuses — research at prestigious universities informs policymaking. One advocate called the board memberships an “infiltration” of polluters into academia. Dharna Noor / The Guardian 3. Firearms are being used in an increasing number of homicides and aggravated assaults in California, a troubling trend in a state with some of the nation’s tightest gun restrictions and whose overall crime rate is decreasing. Guns were used in 71.2% of homicides in 2022 compared to 68% in 2019. The last time guns were used in such a high percentage of homicides was “at the peak of our violent crime wave” in the early 1990s, one expert said. Experts struggled to explain the trend, but noted that overall crime did increase during the pandemic. Terry Castleman / Los Angeles Times 4. A San Jose day care facility where two toddlers drowned this week had its license suspended and is facing an $11,000 fine. Two 1-year-old girls were pronounced dead at the hospital after being discovered in the facility’s pool Monday morning, and a third child survived the incident. State regulators issued multiple citations to the day care center in the past year, most recently for improperly documenting checks on sleeping children — but always said the pool met state requirements. Police are still investigating the case. Rick Hurd and Jakob Rodgers / Mercury News 5. Consider turning to artificial intelligence the next time you go through a breakup. A new app created by a Stanford graduate called “Texts from my ex” is using AI to analyze message history between two people and rate their compatibility. One user said the app scored her and her ex-boyfriend an abysmal four out of 10, noting that she was “as smooth as a porcupine.” The app’s founder said that since launching in July, Texts from my ex has garnered over 30,000 users. This is, clearly, a service in high demand. Rae Witte / The Wall Street Journal You’re all caught up. Thanks for reading Morning, Trojan, and have a good day.

Some have accused the Cardinal Divas — who made their debut at the football game versus Fresno State — of appropriating HBCU culture at a “predominantly white institution.” The squad made an appearance on the “Jennifer Hudson Show” Tuesday. ( Lyla Bhalla-Ladd / Annenberg Media ) 🌴 In L.A. A 17-year-old and his stepmother were arrested in connection to the slaying of rapper PnB Rock at a South L.A. restaurant earlier this month. Authorities are still seeking the boy’s father, Freddie Lee Trone. ( City News Service ) Caltrans will close all lanes of the 101 between White Oak and Balboa from 10 p.m. Saturday to 10 a.m. Sunday.

If approved, the wider federation — which governs high school sports across the state — could make it an official sport as soon as next school year.

The state has long issued restricted driver’s licenses to those same immigrants, but that’s meant little for those who don’t or can’t drive.

Police said that all the victims were over the age of 18. ( Kellen Browning, Shawn Hubler and Eduardo Medina / New York Times ) 🏆 The Sports Corner with Chris Bibona Mahanth Chirravuri. Remember the name. The freshman golfer continued to impress with a 6-over 219 performance (20th overall) at the Inverness Intercollegiate in Toledo, Ohio, on Tuesday. This week’s tournament was Chirravuri’s second top-20 finish in a row, and first time leading the team in overall scoring. The Dodgers set a new single-season franchise record with the team’s 107th regular season win last night. The milestone was actualized with a 1-0 extra innings victory against the San Diego Padres. After the series finale in San Diego tomorrow, the Dodgers will cap off the regular season with an unusual six-game series at home against the Colorado Rockies. As it stands Thursday, Los Angeles first baseman Freddie Freeman is in line to win the MLB batting title, and left handed pitcher Julio Urias has all but clinched the National League ERA title. ⭐️ A bonus from The Sack Trump Picks Shakira as Running Mate in 2024 Presidential Campaign.

Your tuition is $3,000 higher Tomo Chien March 06, 2024 p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Good morning. It’s Wednesday, and I’m reading about Shohei Ohtani’s new “ normal Japanese ” wife. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC’s undergraduate tuition will rise by 4.9% next year to a grand total of $69,904. Here are some things you could buy with the $3,264 add-on: an 83-inch smart TV. A Prada Handbag. A SMEG dual-fuel kitchen range. Three MacBook Airs. A five-day Hawaiian luxury vacation. Eight meals at The French Laundry. A 10-month lease on a 2024 Jeep Wrangler. Thirteen autographed Caleb Williams posters ( with frame ). A 46-year supply of three-ply toilet paper. Three hundred eighty-four caramel lattes at Panera. A full semester at a public university . Elizabeth Kunz / Daily Trojan 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] For the first time in three decades, California won’t have a female senator. That’s because Rep. Adam Schiff, a Burbank Democrat who made his name leading Donald Trump’s first impeachment trial, successfully managed to box out Democratic Reps. Katie Porter and Barbara Lee in a blockbuster Senate primary. Schiff will face Republican Steve Garvey — a political novice who Schiff boosted with an ad blitz so he could face a weak opponent in the general election — come November. Garvey is probably toast . Amanda Becker / The 19th 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Looking for summer work? LA County is in desperate need of lifeguards — and it’s coughing up cash to fix that. Hourly wages now sit at up to $25.87, a 20% increase from last year. Guards working on lakes can make up to $30.50, and the county is running a free program to train young people to pass the certification exam. There are also some, well, questionable recruitment changes: The swim test is 40% shorter, and the age requirement is now just 16. It takes around 500 lifeguards to staff the county’s pools and lakes over the summer, but only about 300 have committed to work this year. Aaricka Washington / LAist 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] You’ll have to sit tight as officials tally ballots in a handful of tense LA County primaries. George Gascón, the county’s unpopular progressive district attorney, looks poised to advance to the general election with 38% of votes counted. Nathan Hochman, the former U.S. assistant attorney general, seems to have the next-best shot at advancing out of a long roster of challengers accusing Gascón of being soft on crime. In one of the most closely watched City Council races, embattled incumbent Kevin de León is clinging to a 900-vote lead with just 10% of ballots in. And speaking of embattled , former Sheriff Alex Villanueva might have a shot at the general election in his Board of Supervisors run, but even if he does, it looks like he’ll get smoked by incumbent Janice Hahn. Josh DuBose / KTLA 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] JuJu Watkins, star freshman guard on the women’s basketball team, was named the Pac-12’s freshman of the year. It’s no shocker. Watkins, who’s widely recognized as a generational talent, set USC’s single-game scoring record and earned the most 30-point performances in school history — not to mention the fact she brought record crowds out to home games and has essentially sparked a Trojan women’s basketball renaissance. She may be single-handedly responsible for keeping anybody interested in USC sports after bad, no-good performances from the football and men’s basketball teams this year. The Trojans will play their first game of the Pac-12 tournament tomorrow.

It’s Friday! Here are the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. USC and a prospective union of graduate student workers tentatively set the dates of a union election — which will determine whether the workers are actually able to unionize — for Feb. 15 and 16. The National Labor Relations Board still needs to draft the formal agreement, which both parties need to sign. Tomoki Chien / Daily Trojan 2. Los Angeles FC is changing the Banc of California Stadium’s name to BMO Stadium — a new naming rights deal with the Bank of Montreal. LAFC won the MLS Cup last fall against Philadelphia. Staff / Associated Press 3. Former LA City Councilmember Jose Huizar pleaded guilty to racketeering and tax evasion charges after denying the allegations for years. Huizar extorted at least $1.5 million in bribes from real estate developers while heading the land use committee, which reviews large-scale development proposals. Michael Finnegan and David Zahniser / Los Angeles Times 4. President Biden visited California on Thursday, pledging to support the state as it recovers from catastrophic rain and flooding. The previous day, Biden said the federal government will cover up to 100% of the cost to public agencies for debris removal. Staff / The Mercury News 5. One California county is finally out of the drought. Del Norte County — a small, rural county home to around 28,000 people in the state’s far north — shows no signs of drought over 90% of its territory.

It’s Tuesday, and I’m reading about how a beloved New York bagel chain is coming to Burbank. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. We’ll see you next when we return from the Thanksgiving break. Enjoy your week! 1. USC graduate student workers have made modest progress at the bargaining table with university negotiators, agreeing on a union security clause which requires union members to pay dues and non-members to pay an agency fee. That clause had been one of the last major sticking points ahead of the union’s Nov. 28 strike deadline. The two parties have tentatively agreed on 81% of the contract. Benjamin Gamson / Daily Trojan 2. More than 700 of OpenAI’s 770 employees threatened to leave the startup if the company’s entire board of directors does not step down, seething over the ouster of former CEO Sam Altman. The employees, writing in an open letter, said they’d join Altman at his new post at Microsoft — adding yet another twist to the three-day saga that has rocked the tech world. Competitors, smelling blood in the water, are already trying to poach OpenAI’s engineers. Nora Mishanec and Chase DiFeliciantonio / San Francisco Chronicle 3. Two more officers alleged that they were hazed and sexually abused while playing for the LA Police Department’s amateur football team. Their allegations, which were filed in a type of claim that’s a precursor to a lawsuit, mirrored what a veteran detective also alleged last month: As rookies on the team, they were herded through a gantlet of officers who groped them and hurled homophobic slurs. Libor Jany and Richard Winton / Los Angeles Times 4. The lot under the Interstate 10 that caught fire and temporarily closed the freeway failed multiple fire inspections over the course of three years, officials said. In fact, Caltrans tried to evict the landlord, Ahmad Anthony Nowaid — who subleased the lot to mostly immigrants who ran blue-collar shops — for failing to pay rent in September. “This is a filthy unmaintained lease,” one inspector wrote in 2022. “Evict tenant and start over.” Rachel Uranga / Los Angeles Times 5. Last summer, the San Diego Humane Society thought it was shipping more than 300 rabbits, guinea pigs and rats to Arizona to find new homes as pets. Turns out they were used as reptile food. The Humane Society of Southern Arizona transferred the animals to a man named Colten Jones, who runs a business called Fertile Turtle that sells live and frozen reptile feed. The humane societies said they’re investigating who arranged the transfer and are exploring filing a lawsuit and hiring a private investigator.

It’s Tuesday, and I hope you had a restful long weekend. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles, and California stories you need to know for today. Share this with a friend 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Greenleaf, a healthy mainstay of the USC Village, is closing. The vegetarian-friendly chain operated in the Village for eight years and will apparently be missed, according to comments on Annenberg Media’s Instagram post. Now seems like an opportune time for Senator Raising Cane’s to deliver on his campaign promise. Alea Motwane / Annenberg Media 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Undocumented students at USC are calling for a permanent, physical resource center on campus. The university offers a range of legal and immigration aid for such students, but it’s currently scattered across different schools and affinity groups. A centralized space would let students “actually thrive,” one advocate said. Katherine Contreras Hernandez / Annenberg Media 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A smattering of small fires broke out across Southern California this weekend as forecasters warned that yet another round of dangerous winds will bring extreme danger today. Crews continued to battle the Eaton and Palisades fires, which are now 87% and 63% contained, respectively. Staff / Los Angeles Times 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] City officials didn’t issue evacuation orders for western Altadena until nearly eight hours after the Eaton fire broke out. That may have been a mistake. All 17 of the confirmed deaths in that fire occurred in the western portion of the town, which was ultimately decimated by the flames. Terry Castleman and Ian James / Los Angeles Times 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Silicon Valley tycoons were front and center at Donald Trump’s inauguration. Many, like Mark Zuckerberg, spent the better part of the last decade attacking Trump. Now, the world’s most powerful men are currying favor with the president. They “stand for little more than the accrual of wealth and power,” wrote The Atlantic’s Damon Beres.

It’s Monday, and I’m reading about how Los Angeles was just ranked the second “rattiest” city in the country — behind Chicago, but ahead of New York. Onto the five USC, LA and California stories you need to know for today. 1. USC football fired its embattled defensive coordinator, Alex Grinch, just a day after losing 52-42 to Washington. It was a long time coming. Even last season, Grinch quickly became a favorite target of analysts and outraged fans looking for answers after a pair of losses to Utah and an embarrassing defeat to Tulane in the Cotton Bowl. Head coach Lincoln Riley had until this weekend stood by Grinch: But a bottom-30 ranked defense that again squandered quarterback Caleb Williams’ generational talent for a second conference loss was no doubt the last straw. Paolo Uggetti / ESPN 2. Bay Area police are investigating a hit-and-run at Stanford University as a hate crime. The victim, who’s an Arab Muslim student, said a white man in his mid-20s made eye contact with him before accelerating and hitting him, shouting an expletive and referring to “you and your people” as he drove away. The student said he recognized the man as somebody “who had previously shown animosity” toward his community. Livia Albeck-Ripka / The New York Times 3. The Highland fire has been fully contained a week after breaking out, fire officials said. The blaze — which had spread rapidly thanks to Santa Ana winds and grass growth promoted by Tropical Storm Hilary — burned 2,487 acres and destroyed at least 13 structures. No civilians sustained injuries, though two firefighters did. Officials are still investigating how the fire started. Will Conybeare / KTLA 4. A San Jose police officer involved in a controversial shooting last year resigned after investigators discovered a trove of racist text messages on his phone, including some that made light of the shooting and referred to the victim by a racial epithet, as well as one that said “I hate Black people.” Last March, the officer — Mark McNamara, who is white — shot a Black man who helped disarm an instigator in a bar fight as he backed out of the door with the confiscated gun in his hand. The department’s chief called the texts “disgusting and horrible.” Robert Salonga / The Mercury News 5. Santa Catalina Island residents are up in arms over a plan to hire sharpshooters on helicopters to eradicate the island’s deer population with AR-15-style rifles. Conservation officials say the deer, which aren’t native to the island, are eating away vegetation and throwing the island’s delicate ecosystem out of balance. But the proposal has enraged residents, who have branded the island’s top conservation biologist as “the woman who killed Bambi” and said they feel left out of the decision-making process.

Check out this hilarious Los Angeles Magazine story on Pete Caroll from 2007. Now, onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Grizzly bears have a homicidal reputation. An 1898 San Francisco newspaper alleged that one bear broke into a pigpen and “sat him down in the midst of the squealing porkers until his belly was made full,” then kidnapped a Native American infant in a papoose. That, no doubt, is in part what led Californians to hunt the bears to extinction by 1924. But, it turns out, it’s probably our fault. A new study found that grizzlies were around 90% vegan before Europeans colonized the West, and that the introduction of livestock is probably what encouraged them to start eating more meat. Katherine J. Wu / The Atlantic 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A second avalanche hit a Lake Tahoe ski resort on Thursday, just a day after another avalanche on an adjoining mountain killed one person. Nobody was hurt in Thursday’s slide. For what it’s worth, avalanches at ski resorts are fairly rare: Just 3% of the 244 avalanche deaths in the U.S. over the last decade have been on maintained resort trails. Backcountry skiers, who fly down remote mountains , run the highest risk. Scott Sonner and Christopher Weber / Associated Press 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Former LA County Sheriff Alex Villanueva is set to testify before an oversight commission about deputy gangs this morning. Villanueva has long denied that gangs — secretive groups of tattooed officers accused of valorizing violence with things like “shooting parties” after officers fire on unarmed civilians — exist in the department. The embattled former sheriff’s testimony is timely: Reports this week confirmed the existence of a previously unknown gang and revealed a coverup in an incident where an officer shot off another deputy’s tattoo . Makenna Sievertson and Frank Stoltze / LAist 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC said it won’t accept any new registered student organizations this semester, an effort to ensure existing clubs are “supported” and “fulfilling the important role they play” on campus. RSOs, which are essentially university-sanctioned clubs, can receive school funding, meet in USC classrooms for free and set up stands at involvement fairs. Students were quick to criticize the university for what they characterized as a lack of transparency and a bureaucratic process. Max Rubenstein / Daily Trojan 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Angelenos who received $1,000 dollars a month as part of the city’s guaranteed income pilot program reported getting “a huge part of my life back,” the chance to invest in their small businesses and seeing “a little bit of light up ahead.” Experts say that similar programs across the country have seen positive effects for participants — even after the programs end. The pilots are “indicating pretty uniformly positive impacts on health, belonging, self-worth, among other outcomes,” one expert said.

Check out the Times’ coverage of the annual Martin Luther King Jr. parade . And now, here are the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Six people, including a 17-year-old mother and her infant, were shot dead in a Tulare County home in what authorities presumed to be a gang-related attack. Many of the victims were shot in the head, the sheriff said, suggesting the killers were methodical and experienced. Jesus Jiménez / The New York Times 2. A prospective union of USC graduate student workers will likely hold a hearing with the National Labor Relations Board starting Wednesday. The hearing — which will determine who’s eligible to join the union — would bring the coalition one step closer to official union certification and allow the workers to strike in the future. Tomoki Chien / Daily Trojan 3. The end is near. Forecasters say California’s storms — which have claimed more lives than the past two years of wildfires — should come to an end this weekend. A cause for concern: The snowpack, at 247% its typical size, could cause more floods when it melts in the spring. Adolfo Flores / The Wall Street Journal 4. The LA Police Department expanded its investigation into the source of the racist City Hall audio recording, serving additional search warrants after an initial round that targeted Twitter and Reddit profiles that posted the tape. Three people heard on the tape said it was recorded without their consent — a criminal offense in California. Richard Winton and Matt Hamilton / Los Angeles Times 5. Nearly a decade ago, state voters OK’d billions of dollars for infrastructure that could catch and store stormwater. None of those major projects ever started. Now, at the tail end of a historic deluge, critics are bemoaning the missed opportunity to take advantage of the storm’s runoff water. Kurtis Alexander / San Francisco Chronicle You’re all caught up.

Here are the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. The suspected Half Moon Bay shooter has a violent history, court records show. 66-year-old Chunli Zhao was previously accused of threatening to split a coworker’s head with a knife and attempting to suffocate his roommate with a pillow. Staff / San Francisco Chronicle 2. The LA County Board of Supervisors banned oil drilling, a potential boon for more than a million people who live near the thousands of oil wells across unincorporated LA County. Culver City and the city of LA made identical decisions in 2021 and 2022, respectively. Erin Stone / LAist 3. Jason King will serve as the new dean of USC’s Thornton School of Music. King currently serves as chair of the Clive Davis Institute in the Tisch School of the Arts at NYU — his alma mater — and replaces interim dean Josh Kun effective July 1. Tony Fajardo / Annenberg Media 4. The Monterey Park and Half Moon Bay shootings were anomalies in many ways: Both were perpetrated by older men, the Monterey Park shooter being the second-oldest such criminal in recent years. Both men were Asian, too, making them each one of roughly 6.4% of mass shooters since 1967 to fall in both those demographic categories. Melissa Healy / Los Angeles Times 5. USC’s undergraduate student government released its slate of senate candidates for the 2023-24 academic year. Sixteen candidates are running for 12 open seats in the senate, which is charged with representing the interests of the school’s undergraduate students.

It’s Thursday, and I’m reading about how a former ESPN sportscaster was ejected out the window in an RV crash, smashed into the highway, then slid through traffic — and still survived . Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Harvard executives are trying to placate Silicon Valley venture capitalists who manage the university’s $51 billion endowment. Some of those investors had criticized the former university president’s congressional testimony as being too soft on antisemitic rhetoric, and are railing against what they see as a pro-Palestinian bias in academia. The placating of investors adds a new dimension to the tumult in higher education since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war — universities had previously only sought to smooth things over with donors, rather than the people managing their money. Juliet Chung and Berber Jin / The Wall Street Journal 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The Biden administration finalized a $1.1 billion deal that’ll keep California’s only nuclear power plant running until 2030. Last year, the Legislature voided a deal that would’ve closed the nearly 40-year-old Diablo Canyon Power Plant in 2025 at the behest of Gov. Gavin Newsom, who argued that the state needed the plant’s output to ward off blackouts and offset climate change’s stresses on the power grid. Environmentalists argue that California has enough energy without the plant’s outputs, and that the aging reactors are a safety liability. Staff / Associated Press 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A Yuba County elections worker was exposed to what was likely a fentanyl-laced envelope on Tuesday. The worker was unharmed. A sheriff’s test found that the envelope’s powdery substance was fentanyl, but officials said more testing is needed from the Department of Justice. Regardless, the incident no doubt underscored this year’s high stakes for election workers, who have already faced death threats and public ridicule on account of baseless claims of election fraud. Ishani Desai / The Sacramento Bee 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A billionaire-backed company revealed detailed plans to build a walkable, affordable city on rural farmland northeast of San Francisco — a “utopia” complete with a transit hub, nightlife and a $400 million pool of down payment assistance for new residents. But the developers face serious challenges. For one, Solano County residents are already skeptical of the group, which surreptitiously gobbled up some 50,000 acres of land and didn’t reveal its plans until last year. And the group, which formally filed a ballot initiative with the county yesterday, needs to collect 13,500 signatures to even have a shot at rezoning the land for housing development. David Sjostedt / The San Francisco Standard 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] We’re loaded. USC reported that its endowment grew by more than $330 million last year to a cool $7.7 billion. (Although if you’ll recall the previous story about Harvard, there are clearly levels to the term “loaded.”) Interestingly, $4 of every $10 the university makes comes from its healthcare services, which account for the university’s largest source of revenue. Student tuition and fees amount to just over a quarter.

Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. A significant heatwave is expected to slam Southern California this weekend, just days after Tropical Storm Hilary drenched parts of the region in nearly a foot of rain. The National Weather Service forecasts that inland communities will receive the highest temperatures, with highs forecast up to 109 degrees. Will Conybeare and Kaj Goldberg / KTLA 2. USC football will take to the Coliseum Saturday evening for its season opener against San Jose State, kicking off the second season of the Lincoln Riley era for the No. 6 ranked Trojans. All eyes will no doubt be on the cast of transfers and freshmen supporting the Heisman-winning Caleb Williams’ encore — a cast that’ll determine the championship quality of the team. Thuc Nhi Nguyen / Los Angeles Times 3. Officials identified the shooter who killed three and injured six at a Trabuco Canyon biker bar as 59-year-old John Snowling, a retired sergeant from the Ventura Police Department. Snowling appeared to target his estranged wife, Marie Snowling, who was dining at the bar; he struck her once in the jaw but she survived. Staff / Los Angeles Times 4. Adding to a seemingly never-ending drama, a California judge Thursday rejected an environmental group’s request to stop the state from extending the life of the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant. The power plant, which produces 9% of the state’s electricity, was previously supposed to shutter by 2025 — until Gov. Gavin Newsom supported an effort to extend its life, to the dismay of safety-minded environmentalists. Michael R. Blood / Associated Press 5. The California High Speed Rail is on its way to becoming a reality after its board of directors cleared the way to screen and choose vendors and manufacturers for the state’s most ambitious transit undertaking yet. The rail service, tentatively planned to open in 2030, would first connect the Central Valley from Merced to Bakersfield, later connecting to LA and the Bay Area.

It’s Wednesday, and we’re reading about how Los Angeles is a doughnut town . Onto the five USC, LA and California stories you need to know for today. 1. An incoming California heat wave is expected to trigger rapid snowmelt on the Sierra Nevada slopes and cause more flooding in the San Joaquin and Owens valleys this week, forecasters say. Temperatures are expected to climb into the high 80s and mid 90s beginning Wednesday, melting one of the largest snowpacks in state history. Hayley Smith / Los Angeles Times 2. A controversial bill aiming to outlaw caste discrimination cleared its first big legislative hurdle, passing through the state Senate Judiciary Committee. If approved by the broader Legislature, the bill could make California the first state in the nation to make caste bias illegal, an issue that is especially contentious within the South Asian community. Deepa Bharath / Associated Press 3. California is expected to ban the sale of new diesel big rigs by 2036 and mandate that large companies swap existing trucks for zero emissions versions by 2042, building off of last month’s decree that half of all heavy-duty truck sales be fully electric by 2035. Trucking companies contend that electric big rigs are still prohibitively costly and lack the necessary range. Nadia Lopez / CalMatters 4. A report found that bystanders account for almost half of all the people killed or injured during police chases initiated by the LA Police Department in the last five years, a continuation of a decades-long pattern. LAPD’s policy is looser than other large cities: Philadelphia, Phoenix and Dallas no longer chase people suspected of misdemeanors, and New York and Chicago banned a maneuver where police bump cars traveling below 35 mph in order to force them to stop. Libor Jany and James Queally / Los Angeles Times 5. Electric vehicles have accounted for 21% of all new vehicle sales in California so far this year. Tesla’s Model 3 and Model Y continue to dominate the market and in fact outsell the state’s three most popular gas-powered models. Chevrolet’s Bolt EUV, BMW’s X5 and Jeep’s Wrangler round out the rest of the five best-selling electric vehicles, though sales continue to be heavily clustered in affluent areas of the San Francisco Bay Area.

We’re reading about how UC Berkeley will offer a Taylor Swift class next semester. Needless to say, Swifties won’t be leaving any “Blank Space” on their course plans. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. The Highland fire in Riverside County exploded to over 2,487 acres on Tuesday, doubling in size since the previous day and putting some 4,000 people under mandatory evacuation orders. The blaze is 10% contained. Officials said Tropical Storm Hilary could partly be to blame for the fire, noting that the heavy rainfall encouraged new grass growth that has since dried up and started feeding the flames. That “green-up” effect, paired with this week’s Santa Ana winds, have turned an otherwise manageable fire into a behemoth. Staff / Los Angeles Times 2. USC students posted flyers for Israelis kidnapped by Hamas Tuesday in front of Tommy Trojan, just days after a viral video showed two people tearing down similar posters around campus. It was a striking visual. The flyers included the names, ages and photos of the more than 200 hostages — many of them children — which students taped on the school’s busiest walkway next to blue and white balloons. “This isn’t a political statement,” said a student who organized the display. “Jewish people on campus are suffering, and Israelis are suffering.” Tomoki Chien / Annenberg Media 3. Later Tuesday evening, a group of some 100 pro-Palestinian demonstrators marched through campus, calling on USC to denounce Israel’s ground invasion of Gaza as a genocide. The protestors at one point accused Annenberg Media and the Daily Trojan of spreading misinformation, stopping outside Wallis Annenberg Hall to make the point. Tuesday’s dueling demonstrations again underscored deep divisions at home as the war in Israel enters its fourth week. Terence Holton and Siena Maniatis / Annenberg Media 4. Tesla won a lawsuit that blamed its autopilot system for a deadly 2019 crash on a Southern California highway, a win for the automaker in the first case where its driver-assistance software was accused of causing a fatal accident. The decision could influence the outcome of similar pending cases and no doubt impact public perception of Tesla’s vehicles, which continue to dominate the U.S. electric car market. The company’s lawyers argued in that case that the driver — who had several drinks before driving, but not enough to make him legally intoxicated — was at fault for the sudden swerve that caused the crash. Jack Ewing / The New York Times 5. Right now, California prosecutors looking to convict suspected car break-in thieves must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the vehicle’s door was locked — something of a tough ask, especially considering that it requires victims, who often have work or are tourists, to testify in court. State Sen. Scott Wiener and San Francisco Mayor London Breed proposed a new law last week that would change that, allowing for convictions based only off evidence of forcible entry.

Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Striking screenwriters reached a tentative deal with Hollywood studios, potentially signaling the end of a strike that ground the movie and television industries to a halt for nearly five months. The screenwriters, represented by the Writers Guild of America, will stop picketing but won’t return to work until the contract — whose details aren’t yet public — is ratified. SAG-AFTRA, the union that represents actors, remains on strike. Mandalit del Barco / NPR 2. Around a million LA County households have trouble accessing enough food, according to a USC study. That number is a 6% increase from last year and the highest recorded rate of food insecurity since 2010. Black and Latino households are two times more likely to be affected than white households, and women are at higher risk than men. Julia Paskin and Kevin Tidmarsh / LAist 3. USC is offering free Narcan, an opioid reversal drug, to students covered by the university’s health insurance plan. The over-the-counter drug is available at USC Pharmacies for pickup. “Anyone can get and carry Narcan in their room, in their car, in their backpack,” said Chief Campus Health Officer Sarah Van Orman. Michael Reo and Joel Robles / Annenberg Media 4. All California public schools must soon offer gender-neutral restrooms, thanks to a law signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom. The law was inspired by the Chino Valley Unified School District’s attempt to restrict transgender students’ access to their gender-identified restrooms. The law is part of a larger bill that seeks to protect LGBTQ+ youths with a host of measures like requiring cultural competency training of LGBTQ+ student issues for all educators. Mackenzie Mays / Los Angeles Times 5. LA developers are scrambling to build more electric-vehicle charging stations, smelling the commercial incentive of luring tenants and customers with a convenient charge. Some ideas are more curious than others. Elon Musk plans to build a drive-in theater and dining complex in Hollywood where Tesla owners can charge up. One developer wants to build a mechanized, automated parking garage that can also charge EVs. And some are already talking about flying taxis. Roger Vincent / Los Angeles Times You’re all caught up.

Thank you to all of you who read our work every morning. We’d recommend subscribing to the Los Angeles Times’ “ Today’s Headlines ” or CalMatter’s “ WhatMatters ” if you’re looking for similar newsletters over the summer. Onto the five USC, LA and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Hollywood’s film and television writers went on strike Tuesday, setting up a mammoth clash between the 11,500 screenwriters and major film studios. Broadly, the writers are calling for more compensation and significant restrictions on the use of generative artificial intelligence. When the writers last went on strike for 100 days in 2007, the LA economy lost an estimated $2.1 billion. John Koblin and Brooks Barnes / The New York Times 2. Students at universities across California are sponsoring a bill that would require colleges to offer free transportation to sexual assault forensic exams. An analysis by a social justice group found that the average University of California student must travel nearly 12 miles to complete such an exam, a discouraging distance for an already reluctant survivor. Mackenzie Mays / Los Angeles Times 3. Despite warming temperatures, 80% of California’s historic snowpack is yet to melt — likely because it hasn’t been quite as hot as expected. Experts say the melt should start in earnest around late May, bad news for the already water-logged Central Valley which will bear the brunt of the flooding. Paul Rogers / The Mercury News 4. California is suing the city of Elk Grove, which is just south of Sacramento, for allegedly breaking the law in declining to fast-track a housing development for homeless people while simultaneously approving a similar market-rate development. The fight between Gov. Gavin Newsom and Elk Grove is yet another extension of Newsom’s long history of aggressive intervention in local homelessness and housing policy. Adam Beam / Associated Press 5. Mayor Karen Bass is facing pushback from city officials who want more funding for the LA Animal Services department. Bass’ proposed $31.7 million budget for the department — an 18% increase from this fiscal year — is still far short of the requested $42 million. The budget-strained department suffers from a staffing shortage that leads to inadequate care for animals. Dakota Smith / Los Angeles Times You’re all caught up.

It is unclear if he’ll face charges. “I do have sympathy for him,” one of the tenants said. “He doesn’t seem like he knows what he’s doing.” Brittany Hope and Helen Jeong / NBC Los Angeles 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC basketball star JuJu Watkins inked a multi-year contract extension with Nike that hands her one of the richest shoe endorsement deals in all of women’s basketball. Last season, the sophomore became the NCAA’s all-time leading scorer among freshmen and led the Trojans to their deepest playoff run in three decades. Shams Charania / ESPN 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Polling shows that one of the most-watched elections in LA County could be a blowout. District Attorney George Gascón is trailing his tough-on-crime challenger, Nathan Hochman, by 30 percentage points. Gascón has come under fire for what critics call radically progressive policies that have in some cases led to repeat murders. Connor Sheets and James Queally / Los Angeles Times 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC’s football fanbase is decidedly lackluster compared to the rest of the Big Ten. What gives? For one, tailgating is confined largely to frat houses and our tiny campus. We have, like, two game day chants. And we probably don’t drink enough. Peyton Dacy / Daily Trojan 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Psychedelics aren’t yet legal in California, but everybody in LA’s already acting like it, declared the owner of a shroom company that hosts downtown psychedelic yoga sessions.

The source of the disruption? Two USC students thought it was a good idea to cross “rooftop sex” off their bucket lists. The event left the campus abuzz with discussions about the repercussions of hookup culture, both public and private. A decade later, the Daily Trojan spoke with students to explore today’s hookup culture at USC. ( Marcel Lacy / Daily Trojan ) 🌴 In L.A. The L.A. City Council could expand under a new motion that would place a ballot measure before voters in 2024 to expand the council based on population growth. Many consider L.A. councilmembers some of the most powerful city leaders in the nation because each member represents relatively large swaths of the population. For context, New York City, which has eight million residents, has 51 council members — each representing about 167,000 residents. L.A. is a city of four million, with 15 members each representing about 260,000 residents. ( Caitlin Hernández / LAist ) Harmful emissions at the Port of L.A. soared during the pandemic. Cancer-causing diesel particulate matter rose 56% compared with 2020, and emissions of nitrogen oxides, the precursor to smog, increased 54% while lung-irritating sulfur oxides rose 145%. ( Tony Briscoe / Los Angeles Times ) Acting L.A. City Council President Mitch O'Farrell stripped councilmembers Gil Cedillo and Kevin de Leon from committee chairmanships and assignments . Both Cedillo and de Leon were heard in the tape that caught former Councilmember Nury Martinez making racist and disparaging comments; neither objected to her remarks in the recording. Both councilmembers have resisted calls from council colleagues and prominent politicians to resign from their posts. ( Brian Melley and Stefanie Dazio / Associated Press ) 🌅 California Two California politicians solicited bribes from cannabis business in exchange for licenses. Federal prosecutors unveiled two plea agreements that detail pay-to-play schemes involving cannabis business licensing to corroborate an L.A. Times report last month that examined how legalization of weed unleashed a wave of corruption across California. ( Adam Elmahrek, Ruben Vives, Robert J.

Here are the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Huntington Beach’s new conservative city council banned the rainbow Pride flag from flying on city property, restricting permissible flags to those representing the government and military. The decision was in sharp contrast to a unanimous council vote two years ago that called for the flag to fly for six weeks every spring. Elly Yu / LAist 2. Shipping companies agreed to pay $45 million to thousands of Southern California fishermen, tour companies and property owners after a pipeline near Huntington Beach ruptured in 2021, spilling 25,000 gallons of crude into the ocean. Staff / Associated Press 3. Experts say many California buildings share a common building flaw with Turkish and Syrian structures that partially contributed to the mass damage in the wake of the devastating 7.8-magnitude earthquake: non-ductile concrete, which has inadequate steel reinforcing bars making the material far too brittle to withstand quakes. Rong-Gong Lin II / Los Angeles Times 4. A grassroots group of students and faculty is calling for the university to reinstate Dr. Arameh Anvarizadeh as director of admissions at the USC Chan Division of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy, contending the university hasn’t been transparent about the reasons for her removal. Anvarizadeh was demoted while on medical leave after maternity leave in June. Jennifer Nehrer / Daily Trojan 5. An estimated 36.3 million trees died in California last year — a jump from 9.5 million in 2021 — according to a report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service. The report pointed to prolonged drought, overgrowth, insect outbreaks and disease as the likely culprits. Stephanie Elam / CNN You’re all caught up.

L.A. County has agreed to allocate $236 million dollars to programs that will build permanent housing for homeless individuals on Skid Row, and offer mental health programs, substance abuse disorder treatment, job placement counselors and child daycare services to those same residents. (Steve Scauzillo / San Gabriel Valley Tribune) PnB Rock, a Philadelphia rapper, was fatally shot in a South L.A. robbery at Roscoe’s Chicken &amp; Waffles. The shooter remains at large. (Kenan Draughorne, Richard Winton and Gregory Yee / Los Angeles Times) L.A. county reported the nation’s first confirmed monkeypox death on Monday. The patient was severely immunocompromised, and the death comes as new monkeypox transmission appears to be slowing across the county. (Paige Austin / Patch) 🌅 California As gasoline prices across the United States fall to normal levels, prices in California are on the rise again — and experts predict that’ll keep happening. Some have pointed to refinery outages as the culprit. (David Lightman / Sacramento Bee) The legalization of recreational marijuana use in California has led to an increase in illegal farms, violence and environmental damage. In many cases, licensed growers are being pushed out of the business by a proliferation of illegal greenhouses in the far north of the state, and communities there have been subject to violence and the environmental ramifications of the unregulated growth. Law enforcement in those counties is spread far too thin to make any meaningful raids on criminal farms.

Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] When California legalized marijuana in 2016, the legislation promised to kneecap black market trade and the violence that comes with it. That hasn’t been the case. A massacre that left six dead last week in a San Bernardino County desert was likely the result of a dispute over illegal marijuana, authorities said. It was just the latest incident of cartel-like violence that’s seen shootings and dismemberments as illegal farms spread through inland desert communities in Southern California, run by growers looking to avoid expensive licensing fees and regulatory costs. Staff / Los Angeles Times 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Adjunct professors in USC’s cinema school will begin voting to unionize today. The adjuncts, who actively work in the film industry while teaching at USC, say the university gives no guarantee they’ll teach the next semester and have no clear path to full-time employment. That, they say, combined with low pay and last year’s dual strikes in Hollywood, has left many struggling to make ends meet. The vote closes in three weeks. Amanda Murphy / Annenberg Media 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] For over a year now, public universities in California have been required by law to offer their students abortion pills. The catch: A good number of them don’t advertise it. Students who were already under financial strain described driving more than 300 miles and shelling out hundreds of dollars to receive medication abortions, not knowing that they could’ve just walked into their campus health clinics. Nearly half of California State University health websites fail to mention that they offer medication abortions. A fifth of University of California campuses are in the same boat. USC, for the record, does offer the service. Jackie Fortiér and Adolfo Guzman-Lopez / LAist 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A coalition of business groups sued California over a law that forces them to publicly disclose their greenhouse gas emissions. The suit argues that the law violates First Amendment protections against compelled speech and that the state is out of line in trying to act as a national environmental regulator. Supporters of the law argue it’s needed to inform consumers and investors as the planet continues to warm at an alarming rate. Paul Kiernan / The Wall Street Journal 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A California bill could make it legal to consume alcohol on public streets designated as “entertainment” zones. State Sen. Scott Wiener, who proposed the bill, said it could help revitalize downtown areas that have struggled to regain foot traffic since the pandemic. Wiener, by the way, is a real character. First, he tried to legalize shrooms . Just the other day we wrote about how he wants to install speed limiters in cars. And now he’s trying to legalize public drinking. He’s prolific.

It’s Tuesday, and I’m reading about how Google will delete inactive accounts starting in December. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Instagram’s algorithm pushes users who follow young girls toward risqué footage of children and overtly sexual adult content. Test accounts created by investigators at The Wall Street Journal — that the journalists set to follow young gymnasts, cheerleaders and teen and preteen influencers — were fed videos that included a child pantomiming a sex act, a young girl lifting her shirt to expose her midriff and a man lying on a bed with what the caption said was a 10-year-old girl. Current and former employees say Meta is aware of the problem but is yet to fix it. Jeff Horowitz and Katherine Blunt / The Wall Street Journal 2. State policymakers are eyeing regulations that would allow Californians to opt out of artificial intelligence-based profiling that helps determine the outcomes of job, loan and housing applications. The regulations would also apply to AI-based advertising. There’s precedent for this: California already requires mobile applications and social media companies to give users the chance to opt out of sharing personal data. The AI regulations, if approved, would look similar. Blake Jones / Politico 3. A new study found that the Salton Sea — a dying desert lake that sits south of Joshua Tree — might hold more lithium than experts previously thought. The federal analysis suggested the lake could contain up to 18 million metric tons of extractable “white gold,” enough to make 382 million electric vehicle batteries. There are fewer than 300 million cars registered in the United States. Sammy Roth / Los Angeles Times 4. The LA City Council is considering a law that would require short-term rentals, including Airbnbs and hotels, to obtain police permits that’ll help the city crack down on “party houses” and properties that draw illicit activity. Airbnb owners are up in arms. The hosts say they don’t want to be fingerprinted as part of criminal background checks and question the proposed $260 fee. “I just ask that you not buckle us in with doing extra hoops to jump through and extra police checks and extra fees,” one host said. Dakota Smith / Los Angeles Times 5. Big-wall rock climbers in the Yosemite Valley say new draft policies from federal agencies could regulate the sport out of existence. The proposal from the National Park Service and U.S. Forest Service would require that park superintendents approve the replacement and installation of new fixed anchors that climbers depend on — which they currently install at will. Climbers say that’ll give superintendents unilateral control over climbing access and potentially lead climbers to use dangerous anchors that are overdue for replacement. Federal regulators say the policy is needed to preserve the wilderness. Gregory Thomas / San Francisco Chronicle You’re all caught up. Thanks for reading Morning, Trojan, and have a good day.

Here are the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. An inter-family feud led to the Tulare County murders that left six dead, including a 16-year-old girl and her infant son. The family of one of the accused shooters had a long history of violence with the family of the victims, and both had ties to California gangs — but not the Mexican cartel, as the county sheriff had originally posited. Matthew Ormseth / Los Angeles Times 2. Ironically, January’s heavy rain across the state could actually lead to an increase in wildfires come summer: The small plants and grasses that sprouted up after the showers will all dry out quickly, leaving the landscape covered in kindling. The heavy rains also impeded prescribed burn efforts. Gabrielle Canon / The Guardian 3. California’s U.S. Senate race is shaping up to be one of the most expensive of the 2024 primary election as Democratic heavyweights Reps. Adam Schiff and Katie Porter jostle for early positioning. It’s all a little awkward, though, as 89-year-old Sen. Diane Feinstein is yet to formally announce whether she’s going to seek reelection. Michael R. Blood / Associated Press 4. Rising prices have left some SoCalGas customers footing bills in the neighborhood of $500 dollars a month, something particularly hard for seniors living on fixed social security checks to cover. In December, the utility pointed to increases in the price of wholesale gas, noting that the company isn’t profiting from the inflated bills. Dennic McCarthy / Los Angeles Daily News 5. A proposed California bill could allow local governments to legalize “cannabis cafes” — cannabis businesses that also serve food and nonalcoholic drinks, which is currently illegal under state law. Proponents of the bill say it could help struggling legitimate marijuana businesses compete with the illegal market. Sophia Bollag / San Francisco Chronicle You’re all caught up.

It’s Monday, and I’m reading about how a golden retriever came to be mayor of a California town. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. The shuttered portion of the Interstate 10 reopened Sunday night, far ahead of initial estimates that said repairs could take weeks or even months. Officials said there was less structural damage than inspectors originally thought and repair crews worked around the clock. Police are still looking for the suspected arsonist who was caught on surveillance video after setting the storage yard under the freeway ablaze. Staff / Los Angeles Daily News 2. OpenAI’s board of directors said its former CEO, Sam Altman, won’t return to his post, days after his shocking ouster and attempted comeback. Altman’s firing from the company responsible for ChatGPT and DALL-E underscored a rift in the artificial intelligence community, where some, like Altman, believe the technology is the most important thing since web browsers, and others warn that moving too fast could be dangerous. Staff / The New York Times 3. A Moorpark professor was arrested and charged with involuntary manslaughter in the death of a Jewish protestor in Thousand Oaks earlier this month. Authorities are yet to detail how they believe Loay Abdelfattah Alnaji, 50, caused the death of 69-year-old Paul Kessler, who ultimately died from wounds he sustained after falling and striking his head on the ground. It’s unclear whether Alnaji made physical contact with Kessler before his fall from publicly available evidence. Richard Winton and Noah Goldberg / Los Angeles Times 4. Hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters forced an early halt to the first day of the California Democratic Convention in Sacramento this weekend, overwhelming security guards and streaming into the convention center. Earlier in the day, activists disrupted a forum of candidates running for U.S. Senate, shouting down Reps. Katie Porter and Adam Schiff, who refused to back a ceasefire in Gaza. They didn’t interrupt Rep. Barbara Lee, who has been a vocal ceasefire advocate — another reminder of the party’s split on the issue. Staff / Politico 5. Tommy Trojan was egged this weekend, adding insult to injury after USC’s 38-20 loss to UCLA in the Coliseum. Luckily, the statue was covered in a protective layer of duct tape, as it traditionally is ahead of the rivalry game. “What can you expect from a school like UCLA?” one student said. “They’re not known for being respectful or honorable.” Personally, I wouldn’t be shocked if a disgruntled USC fan was to blame.

Sublist , a startup founded by a USC senior, lets users list and rent apartments for sublease: a potential life-saver for any last-minute housing search. The platform requires users to verify their student status with a USC-issued email address, and even lets sellers list rooms by the day. At a glance, the platform boasts a handful of affordable private bedrooms for this summer. Justin Ha / Daily Trojan 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] It just got a lot harder to read the news in California. Google said it’s blocking California-based news outlets from appearing in search results for an unspecified number of users in the state: a move essentially in protest of pending legislation that would force Google to pay newspapers a percentage of the ad revenue it makes off their content. The tech giant previously employed the same hissy-fit antics when faced with a similar law in Canada meant to provide a lifeline to the news industry that was decimated by the advent of digital marketing. Bobby Allyn / NPR 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] McDonald’s reintroduced bagel sandwiches at its locations across California, an effort to boost restaurant traffic amid rising labor costs given the state’s new $20 fast food minimum wage. The company said it expects the reinstated menu item, which has historically been a fan-favorite, plus an ad blitz and new optimization measures to boost sales by as much as 10%. Fun fact: McDonald’s contributes around $5 billion to California’s GDP. Daniela Sirtori / Bloomberg 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A group of USC social work students is railing the university to install desks and chairs that accommodate plus-sized people in the classroom. Standard chairs, they say, aren’t “size-inclusive.” The group of some 20 protestors demonstrated on Trousdale last Wednesday, wrapped in yellow caution tape while sitting on metal folding chairs; they originally wanted to bring the offending chairs out to the protest, but said they were worried about logistical issues and “getting in trouble.” Quinten Seghers / Daily Trojan 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] LA County health officials said a traveler with measles visited a handful of tourist hotspots late last month, and warned anybody potentially exposed to confirm that they’re vaccinated against the virus. Between March 30 and April 1, the traveler visited locations including, but not limited to: the Sheraton hotel next to LAX. A nearby Denny’s. Universal Studios. An Inglewood Jack in the Box. Santa Monica Pier. Then Denny’s again. The real cautionary tale here might be the travel itinerary. I’m wishing the tourist a speedy recovery, and also plugging a guide to the LA food scene.

Will the Los Angeles rain affect today’s voter turnout? Bad weather can make the wait at a polling station seem like a daunting task; a Dartmouth study found that 1 inch of rainfall above the normal rain for the day can decrease voter turnout by up to 1%. Eve Washington and John Keefe / The New York Times 3. Federal immigration authorities want to deport David DePape, the man accused of assaulting the husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi with a hammer — but the district attorney refused to turn over the Canadian citizen, citing San Francisco’s sanctuary city policies. Rachel Swan / San Francisco Chronicle 4. A dramatic expansion in battery storage helped the state power grid avoid outages during September’s record-breaking heat wave, a report from the California Independent System Operator found. The state has added 3,250 megawatts of battery storage since 2020, allowing the power grid to draw on more energy stored from solar panels at night. Erin Stone / LAist 5. California settled a lawsuit against a German company for its role in the 2015 Volkswagen emission scandal. Volkswagen — and later Fiat Chrysler — installed devices in diesel passenger vehicles that made it seem like the cars met emissions requirements during tests, while in actuality they were polluting many times the legal limit. Don Thompson / Associated Press 6. Strippers at a dive bar in North Hollywood voted to join the Actors’ Equity union, seeking a stronger voice in negotiating wages and protections against on-the-job harassment from patrons. But the club’s management is challenging the validity of the vote, claiming that some dancers aren’t direct employees. Kevin Smith / San Gabriel Valley Tribune 7. The Orange County Board of Eduction is facing backlash over a proposed curriculum ban. The policy, proposed by Trustee Ken Williams, would forbid teaching curriculum that advocates for abolishing the police or claims that systemic racial oppression exists in America. Opponents decried the ban as “racist and backwards.” Hosam Elattar / Voice of OC Nation / world In closing pitches, Republicans predicted big wins in races across the country while Democrats scrambled to attack opponents and appeal to moderates.

The American Civil Liberties Union and L.A. county officials have agreed to a proposal that would address what activists have called “abysmal” conditions in the county’s jail system. Previously, the ACLU had made noise about the jail system that it said chained inmates — many of whom had not yet been convicted — to chairs for days and forced them to sleep on concrete floors with no bedding.

It’s Thursday, and I’m reading about how California’s “angriest sea otter” may have finally found peace as a mother . Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. A man armed with a kitchen knife attacked a Studio City family early Wednesday morning, shouting “I’m going to kill you because you are Jewish.” The family successfully fought the attacker until police arrived, and no injuries were reported. Authorities said the suspect, Daniel Garcia, may have been intoxicated and could’ve been tipped off by the mezzuzah the family had on its doorframe. The attack underscored the deep divisions in the United States as the war between Israel and Hamas nears its third week. Marc Sternfield / KTLA 2. A 22-year-old who allegedly killed four Pepperdine University students in a car crash last week said he was being chased in a road rage incident. Authorities said there’s no evidence to support the claim and noted that Fraser Michael Bohm’s car reached speeds as high as 104 mph in a 45 mph zone. Bohm, who passed all field sobriety tests and has no criminal record, faces multiple life sentences if convicted of the four counts of gross vehicular manslaughter. Christopher Weber / Associated Press 3. Gov. Gavin Newsom met with Chinese President Xi Jinping as part of a weeklong trip to negotiate climate partnerships Wednesday in Beijing. The governor said the two leaders spoke about working together to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels, but critics were quick to accuse the governor of using the trip to burnish his national reputation as he gears up for what many suspect will be a 2028 presidential run. “It’s the make-believe president tour,” said one Republican state assemblymember. Tiffany May and Shawn Hubler / The New York Times 4. Prosecutors fear that hundreds of criminal investigations could be compromised by the LA Police Department’s latest scandal, in which at least two officers are accused of making illegal stops and stealing from suspects. As many as 15 other officers are involved in the still-unfolding investigation, meaning thousands more cases could be jeopardized if prosecutors can no longer rely on their testimony. Richard Winton and Libor Jany / Los Angeles Times 5. An off-duty pilot who said he took psychedelic mushrooms before attempting to cut the engines on a San Francisco-bound flight may have jeopardized the effort to legalize the drug in California. Just one negative story can often stop progressive movements dead in their tracks — as may be the case here. Gov. Newsom will no doubt be relieved that he vetoed a bill earlier this month that would’ve legalized some psychedelics, citing the need for more guardrails. State Sen. Scott Wiener, who introduced the first bill, said he still plans to spearhead another legalization effort. Dustin Gardiner / Politico You’re all caught up.

It’s Tuesday, and we’re looking at a list of the highest-paid employees in the University of California system. Spoiler: None of them have anything to do with academics. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. A Jewish man died Monday from injuries he sustained during a Thousand Oaks protest over the Israel-Hamas war. Paul Kessler, 69, fell backward and hit his head on the ground while counterprotesting a pro-Palestinian group Sunday afternoon. Witnesses said it was unclear whether he was physically struck by an opposing demonstrator, but police said they were investigating the incident as a homicide and possible hate crime. Staff / The New York Times 2. Eastside residents are up in arms over a proposed new building on USC’s Health Sciences Campus, worried it’ll help jack up prices in the area and exacerbate a decades-long wave of gentrification that they blame the affluent private university for. USC, for its part, said the proposed seven-story building would help its researchers continue to address health disparities in local communities through research. Karen Garcia / Los Angeles Times 3. Aggressive shark activity and an injured, beached whale led officials to close Sunset Beach in Huntington Beach until 4:30 p.m. Tuesday. Shark sightings in the area are a common occurrence, but the thrashing in the water that beachgoers reported seeing before the whale washed ashore with bite marks was cause for concern. The whale was humanely euthanized after experts found it was “very sick, underweight” with a rapidly declining condition. Yusra Farzan / LAist 4. The captain of the Conception dive boat that caught fire and killed 34 people in 2019 was convicted of criminal negligence by a federal jury. Jerry Boylan, 69, was charged with a pre-Civil War statute colloquially known as seaman’s manslaughter, and faces up to 10 years behind bars in his February sentencing. Prosecutors said Boylan failed to post a roving night watch that could’ve spotted the fire earlier, and never properly trained his crew in firefighting. Stefanie Dazio / Associated Press 5. A hangar at a historic Orange County air base caught fire early Tuesday morning, prompting a response from multiple fire agencies who are still battling the blaze with helicopters typically used to fight large brush fires. There were no injuries immediately reported and authorities are still unsure what started the fire. The hangar in Tustin first became operational in World War II and was decommissioned in 1999, and was one of the world’s largest freestanding wooden structures — perhaps part of the problem here.

The tiered increases depend on the size of your home, but the multi-family units typical of student housing will see monthly rates soar from $24.33 to $55.95. Larger apartment buildings will be unaffected. The rate hikes are part of the city’s effort to close a $1 billion shortfall.

Today, we’re debuting a return to this newsletter’s original format (or something close to it): just five USC, Los Angeles and California stories. No more sports, national and “other” reads. We’re going back to the basics, which I’m hoping will make these emails more digestible. The other sections were fun experiments, but ultimately distracted from the most important stories. And now, here's the news you need to know for today. 1. A jury ruled that the NCAA is not responsible for the death of former USC linebacker Matthew Gee. The 1990 Rose Bowl winner’s widow alleged that the NCAA failed to protect Gee from repeated head trauma in a case that could affect countless other athletes making similar claims. Brian Melley / Associated Press 2. The University of California academic workers strike is heading into its third week. The nearly 50,000-person strike has grounded much of the research, grading and teaching to a halt across the 10-campus university system as finals week approaches. Hillary Ojeda / Lookout Santa Cruz 3. California will issue $25 million in grants to support guaranteed income projects across the state. The money should reach some 1,975 people part of small, short-term pilot programs targeting specific groups like foster youth and pregnant women. Evan Symon / California Globe 4. A California appellate court ruled that only the state can mandate COVID-19 vaccinations in school districts, siding with an initial ruling that blocked a San Diego Unified School District immunization requirement. In October 2021, Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state would impose a mandate, but the Department of Public Health has since punted it to at least July 2023. John Woolfolk / The Mercury News 5.

Onto the five USC, LA and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Tens of thousands of Kaiser Permanente workers are poised to strike Wednesday morning, targeting facilities in five states — California included. The workers, who accused Kaiser of negotiating in bad faith and committing unfair labor practices, are asking for a solution to the healthcare system’s chronic staffing crisis and better pay and benefits. Kaiser is the largest private health-care provider in the country. Spencer Kimball / CNBC 2. San Francisco could soon ban right-hand turns on red lights to increase pedestrian and bicyclist safety. The initiative’s supporters say it would encourage walking, stop cars from blocking crosswalks and, most importantly, curb serious injuries in car accidents. Experts say it’s unlikely that a similar effort in “car-centric” LA could gain any steam, though some advocates are still pushing for initiatives in smaller cities like West Hollywood that could inform regional change. Salvador Hernandez / Los Angeles Times 3. LA’s ethics commission said there’s “probable cause” to believe that Councilmember John Lee violated ethics laws while working for a former council member. Lee, who is running for reelection to represent voters in the West San Fernando Valley, denied the claims that, among other things, he accepted gifts during a 2017 trip to Las Vegas that exceeded the city’s gift limit. The commission will reconvene to determine whether Lee actually committed the crimes, and if so, what penalties to issue. Linh Tat / Los Angeles Daily News 4. LA Mayor Karen Bass appointed a new top homelessness and housing advisor. Lourdes Castro Ramirez, Bass’ pick, currently manages California's housing budget and will begin her position in November when current advisor Mercedes Marquez steps down. Bass was cagey about the circumstances of Marquez’s resignation, only citing “federal retiree rules.” Nick Gerda / LAist 5. Gov. Gavin Newsom said Laphonza Butler, his interim Senate appointee, could choose to run for the seat previously held by the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein if she so chooses. He then listed all the reasons she’d be a good candidate. Butler isn’t expected to share her plans until after Feinstein’s memorial on Thursday, though the race’s current contenders — Democratic heavyweights Barbara Lee, Adam Schiff and Katie Porter — will no doubt be miffed by Newsom’s remarks.

An effort to recall LA City Councilmember Kevin de León failed to garner enough signatures to put the matter on the ballot. The recall campaign — which sought to oust de León for his role in the racist leaked tape scandal last October — fell 10,000 signatures short of the 20,437 it needed. Linh Tat / Los Angeles Daily News 2. Polls close Tuesday in a special election to replace former LA City Councilmember Nury Martinez, who resigned for her role in same scandal that implicated de León. Expect a low turnout: Just 108 people have visited polling centers since they opened a week and a half ago, and the county has received a meager 8,000 absentee ballots. Dakota Smith / Los Angeles Times 3. When NASA launches its first crewed mission to the moon for the first time in five decades, an LA County native will pilot the ship. Victor Glover, of Pomona, previously piloted Space X’s Crew Dragon spacecraft, served as a flight engineer on the International Space Station and was a Navy test pilot before becoming an astronaut. The Artemis II mission is set to launch in 2024. Lucas Combos and Paige Austin / Patch 4. Masks are no longer required in California healthcare settings, senior care facilities, homeless centers and correctional facilities — effectively phasing out one of the state’s last COVID restrictions. Workers in those same settings are also no longer required to be vaccinated. Ema Sasic / Palm Springs Desert Sun 5. USC’s official mariachi band won Songfest, a university competition for student performers dating back to 1954. The competition raises money for Troy Camp, an organization that mentors underprivileged youth in South LA. Eleven groups entered this year’s competition, including those performing dance, a cappella, magic and comedy. Staff / Annenberg Media You’re all caught up.

California lawmakers appear to have quietly given up the effort to impose a COVID vaccine mandate for schoolchildren. Sources within the state Department of Public Health said the end of the state’s COVID state of emergency on Feb. 28 essentially spells the end of the vaccination requirement that never was — at least at the state level. Diana Lambert / EdSource 2. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric will face a manslaughter trial for its role in the devastating 2020 Zogg Fire that killed four people and destroyed more than 200 homes. The utility company — which serves most of Northern California — is accused of failing to take down a pine tree that was previously marked for removal and ultimately ended up sparking the fire when it fell on a distribution line. Staff / Associated Press 3. Hundreds of antisemitic flyers were distributed across the UC Santa Barbara campus and surrounding neighborhood earlier this week, sending shockwaves through the community. Authorities said they identified the extremist group responsible for the flyers, noting the group aimed to generate more revenue by directing people to its website. Jacob Wheeler / Annenberg Media 4. Tom Girardi, a former high-profile lawyer, was indicted by federal grand juries in LA and Chicago on embezzlement charges. Girardi — famous for helping environmental activist Erin Brockovich go after PG&amp;E — is accused of stealing some $18 million from his clients over nearly a decade. Jenny Gross / The New York Times 5. State lawmakers are revisiting legislation that would put a cap on the price of insulin, limiting what diabetics pay out of pocket for the medication to $35 for a month-long supply. The current copay limit is $250 in a state home to an estimated 3.2 million people who are diabetic, many of whom rely on the drug. Ana B. Ibarra / CalMatters You’re all caught up.

It’s Wednesday, and I’m reading about why Los Angeles is a confusing jumble of the county, the city, unincorporated areas and other cities entirely. It’s all about water rights , apparently. Onto the five USC, LA and California stories you need to know for today. 1. The LA City Council greenlit a proposal that’ll allow landlords to raise rent by up to 4% next year, a compromise between an extended COVID-era rent freeze and the 7% cap that would be in place otherwise. The plan only applies to units covered by the city’s rent stabilization ordinance. Tenant advocates argued that an end to the rent freeze could be catastrophic for vulnerable renters, but landlords noted that they haven’t been able to raise rent in more than three years amid soaring inflation. Julia Wick and Dorany Pineda / Los Angeles Times 2. The section of the Interstate 10 damaged by a fire this weekend will be repaired in three to five weeks, officials said. Inspectors who assessed the site said the damaged section can be retrofitted rather than torn down and replaced entirely, meaning the traffic nightmare will be far shorter than some had initially feared. Investigators are still determining who started the fire, which they suspect was caused by arson. Staff / CNN 3. The man who broke into former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s home and attacked her husband with a hammer last year offered a bewildering testimony in his trial. David DePape said he planned to don a unicorn costume and interrogate Pelosi about what he believed were government plots against Donald Trump — and that he’d break her kneecaps if she lied. But Pelosi wasn’t home at the time of the attack: just her husband, Paul, who DePape struck in the head with a hammer. “I felt bad for him because we kind of had, like, a really good rapport,” DePape told jurors. Dustin Gardiner / Politico 4. Students renting at the Hub LA Figueroa apartments are set to move in Thursday, at last ending a three-month saga of delays where renters were forced to live in temporary accommodations. The embattled apartment building had faced construction delays, permitting issues and the death of a contractor that all postponed the new building’s promised August move-in date. A few amenity spaces, like the rooftop pool, still aren’t complete. Rebecca Speier / Annenberg Media 5. Just 20 extended families consume the majority of water the Imperial Valley draws from the Colorado River, often using more water than small cities to grow hay that’s shipped to foreign countries. Many of the farmers are descendants of early homesteaders and thus work land that’s guaranteed large amounts of cheap river water. “You’ve got this small group of families, and … they’ve all intermarried,” a county tax assessor said. “It’s almost like a feudal type system.” Nat Lash / ProPublica and Janet Wilson / The Desert Sun You’re all caught up.

Onto the five USC, LA and California stories you need to know for today. 1. The LA City Council is looking to expand its ranks, potentially as much as doubling its 15-member body in a move that could in theory make council members more responsive to their constituents. But there’s a catch: The expansion might not happen until 2032, a delay that would allow the city to take advantage of 2031’s regularly scheduled redistricting process — rather than have to spend money on an additional one before then. The delay would also mean the expansion wouldn’t affect any current council members’ reelection bids. David Zahniser / Los Angeles Times 2. California lawmakers banned four carcinogenic chemicals found in popular processed foods and drinks, effective 2027. The bill — which bans red dye no. 3, potassium bromate, brominated vegetable oil and propyl paraben — is the first of its kind in the nation and is expected to force the manufacturers of foods like Peeps to change their recipes. Adam Beam and Sophie Austin / Associated Press 3. Former LA County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said he’ll run for the county Board of Supervisors, a long-shot bid to return to the political limelight for the controversial figure. Villanueva, who was accused of a host of wrongdoing over his four-year tenure in the sheriff’s office, lost to Robert Luna in a landslide last fall. KJ Hiramoto / Fox 11 4. The LA County Board of Supervisors banned all departments from selling firearms to the public, a direct reaction to the controversy the Probation Department stirred in January when it listed more than 300 handguns on its site for sale just days after the Monterey Park mass shooting. It’s not uncommon for law enforcement agencies, including the sheriff’s department, to sell firearms they have a surplus of or obtain through court seizures. Rebecca Ellis / Los Angeles Times 5. Gov. Gavin Newsom said he’ll meet with the planners of a futuristic city whose development is backed by Silicon Valley billionaires. In his first public comments on the project, Newsom criticized the investors for secretively buying the more than 50,000 acres of rural Northern California land where the planned site sits. Gubernatorial support could be key for the lofty project, which already faces an uphill battle with local land use laws. Ben Fox and Lara Korte / Politico You’re all caught up.

Here are the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Fentanyl deaths soared 1,280% between 2016 and 2021 in LA County, a Department of Public Health report found. Black people died at disproportionately higher rates, which some experts have suggested could be tied to racial inequities in access to naloxone, an overdose reversal drug. Emily Alpert Reyes and Rebecca Ellis / Los Angeles Times 2. The University of California reached tentative agreements with a quarter of its 48,000 striking academic workers. Still, those workers are expected to stay on the picket line until the contract — which would make 7,000 of the postdoctoral students the highest paid in the country — is ratified possibly next week. Nanette Asimov / San Francisco Chronicle 3. LA police served several search warrants as they seek to determine who recorded the infamous leaked conversation in which city council members made racist remarks. In California, it’s illegal to record a conversation without the consent of all parties involved — a crime that can be prosecuted as either a felony or misdemeanor. Richard Winton / Los Angeles Times 4. USC students, many of them Chinese nationals, held a fiery rally on Tuesday night calling for an end to Xi Jinping’s zero-COVID policy while chanting “liberty or death.” The protest ran parallel to a nationwide uproar in China sparked by an apartment fire in Xinjiang that killed 10 — which some suspect turned deadly because residents were locked in their homes due to COVID lockdown controls. Jonathan Martin / Annenberg Media 5. Fourteen Northern California priests were accused of sexually abusing children in lawsuits this week. The suits came as the three-year window set by Assembly Bill 218 — which temporarily tossed the statute of limitations for victims of long-ago child sexual abuse — nears its close.

It’s Wednesday, and as Mayor Karen Bass looks to expand her homelessness initiative, we’re rereading Ezra Klein’s column in The New York Times on the matter. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. LA County flunked the American Lung Association’s annual “State of the Air” report and held onto its nearly 24-year running title of smoggiest metropolitan area in the nation. The Central Valley cities of Bakersfield and Visalia tied for the country’s worst fine particle pollution. All but three California counties didn’t flunk the report, underscoring the need to regulate emissions as wildfires also plague the nation’s most populous state. Tony Briscoe / Los Angeles Times 2. Mayor Bass released the first budget proposal of her term on Tuesday, calling for increased spending on the police department, homelessness programs, anti-gang efforts and animal shelters. Her plan to build up the LA Police Department involves persuading 200 recently retired officers to return to the force for at least 12 months. The City Council has until the end of May to review, revise and approve Bass’s budget. Staff / Los Angeles Times 3. The LA Unified School District reached a tentative deal with the teachers’ union to increase pay by more than 21% over three years and lower the average class size — an agreement separate from the one reached earlier this month between the school district and its service staff. The settlement is expected to bring stability to a school district that saw a a three-day strike in March and a tumultuous six-day strike in January 2019. Corina Knoll / The New York Times 4. This winter’s heavy storms exacerbated groundwater contamination in the San Joaquin and Salinas valleys by flushing decades’ worth of fertilizer into the ground. Nitrate, contained in fertilizer, can lead to the dangerous “blue baby syndrome” and has been linked to cancer. More than 1,000 households affected by the nitrate contamination receive state-funded water deliveries, but any long-term solution will likely mean reducing or better controlling fertilizer application. Alastair Bland / CalMatters 5. The NBA Playoffs will include all four California teams — Lakers, Clippers, Warriors and Kings — for the first time since they’ve all shared statehood. The four teams have been in California since 1985 when the Kings relocated from Kansas City to Sacramento. In yet another first, the Warriors and Kings will play each other in the opening round, the first playoff matchup between the two Northern California franchises thus far.

Some good news: The San Francisco Bay Area is seeing a reemergence of beavers , which were once hunted to extinction in the region. And now, here are the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. The LA County Department of Mental Health is looking to expand its student trainee program as it faces glaring staff shortages. Officials hope that the program — which currently works with 16 local universities to offer some 100 internships a year — can help establish a professional pipeline to remedy its recruitment and retention woes. Robert Garrova / LAist 2. California will become the first state to automatically seal criminal records for most people who complete their sentences. Activists have long contended that those records, when left unsealed, can prevent formerly incarcerated people for getting jobs, housing and schooling. Soumya Karlamangla / The New York Times 3. A staffing crisis in LA County’s juvenile halls has led to more fights, attacks on officers and the controversial use of chemical sprays on children to stop brawls. The halls, which house around 370 youths, saw a 50% increase in the number of times that officers used force in the first half of 2022 compared to the same period last year. James Queally / Los Angeles Times 4. Gov. Gavin Newsom told the White House that he won’t challenge President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination in 2024. In fact, Newsom said he won’t run even if Biden doesn’t seek reelection — doubling down on a promise he made last month in the one and only gubernatorial debate. Jonathan Martin / Politico 5. The federal government will spend $250 million to lower the environmental impact of the Salton Sea’s drying lake bed. The Southern California lake is largely fed by runoff from Imperial Valley farms, which are being forced to cut down on water use by tightening restrictions.

Support our journalism 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Southern California’s new Trump-appointed U.S. attorney vowed to investigate potential fraud and corruption in regional homelessness programs. Bill Essayli specifically called out LA County, citing recent audits that found a stunning lack of transparency in its spending. “Taxpayers deserve answers,” Essayli said. Christopher Weber / Associated Press 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A new bill in the U.S. House would prevent college athletes from ever being classified as employees of their schools. It isn’t the first proposed legislation of its type, and it’s unclear how far it’ll actually get. But it represented yet another roadblock for a long-running athlete labor movement that has largely stalled out under Trump’s watch. Steve Berkowitz / USA Today 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Calling USC’s financial aid office could become slightly less of a pain next year, thanks to a student government initiative that’ll make the phone system read out expected wait times.

Fellow freshman Dakota Maichel is “lowkey okay with it” because her chosen flavor wasn’t cut. Others just want to watch the world burn. “I’m glad they did it,” said sophomore Derrick Shabani, citing the drink’s sugar content.

Yesterday, we wrote about how Silicon Valley billionaires are looking to build a utopian city in rural Northern California. Check out these photos of the land where they hope to make that happen. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. The LA City Council is looking to sue the state of Texas and its governor, Greg Abbott, over the state’s controversial busing policy that has delivered more than 400 migrants to LA since June. The council’s unanimously approved directive instructs the city attorney to begin any potential civil legal action and investigate whether “human trafficking, kidnapping or any other crime was committed.” Julia Wick / Los Angeles Times 2. USC will switch its learning management system from Blackboard to Brightspace’s D2L beginning summer 2024, after Blackboard said it plans to discontinue its current product. Officials said that, starting in the spring, select classes will pilot D2L ahead of the full rollout in May. Quinten Seghers / Daily Trojan 3. Anti-LGBTQ activist groups announced an effort to place three initiatives hostile to transgender youth on California’s November 2024 ballot. The initiatives — which require school staff to out transgender students to their parents, ban transgender students from sports that align with their gender identity and block gender-affirming medical care — each need 550,000 valid signatures to make it onto the ballot. Erin Allday / San Francisco Chronicle 4. California will invest $750 million to build housing and clean transportation in “jobs-rich” areas that lack affordable services. The project will produce about 2,500 affordable homes, 150 zero-emission buses and remove the equivalent emissions of 178,000 gas-powered cars in a single year, according to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office. Travis Schlepp / KTLA 5. The man believed to have crashed his car into an Uber at 100 mph, killing three in South LA over the weekend, was on probation tied to a 2020 murder case. Gregory James Black Jr. allegedly T-boned the Uber while running red lights and speeding up Vermont Avenue, killing three women in their 20s and injuring another passenger and the driver.

First: the Undergraduate Student Government’s election results came out yesterday . And second, Annenberg Media’s own Ngai Yeung and Sam Moskow made it to the Los Angeles Times with a powerful report on sexual abuse within Southern California churches. Now, onto the (additional) USC, LA and California stories you need to know for today. 1. The LA Police Department’s largest employee union wants its officers to stop responding to a host of non-violent calls as a part of upcoming contract negotiations. The shift to unarmed responders would free up a police force that the union characterized as understaffed to focus on violent crime and improve morale. David Zahniser / Los Angeles Times 2. USC shuttle drivers and dispatchers rallied Tuesday in support of their bid to unionize and join the Service Employees International Union Local 721, the largest public-sector union in Southern California. The shuttle workers’ effort will hinge on a March 23 election date set by the National Labor Relations Board, decided by a simple majority vote of the 32 workers in the prospective unit. Tomoki Chien / Daily Trojan 3. The LA County District Attorney’s Office said it wrongfully convicted a man who’s spent 38 years in prison after new DNA evidence exonerated him beyond a shadow of doubt. Maurice Hastings, now 69, was found guilty in 1983 of killing an Inglewood woman and two additional attempted murders. Prosecutors had originally sought the death penalty, but failed. Frank Stoltze / LAist 4. LA County agreed to pay Vanessa Bryant and three of her daughters nearly $30 million to settle a lawsuit after first responders shared graphic photographs of the 2020 helicopter crash that killed Kobe Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna. The county maintained that, while responders did share the photos with friends, they never made it to the internet and all copies have been destroyed. Fred Shuster / City News Service 5. Perhaps never before has hand sanitizer caused USC so much grief — until earlier this month, when a battery-powered sanitizing station sparked a fire at an on-campus apartment. Now, USC Housing will swap all of its automatic hand sanitizing stations in favor of manual pumps. Housing officials originally told residents that the fire was a suspected case of arson, but changed their tune when they discovered the dispenser was battery-operated.

Nichols died three days after being beaten by police during a traffic stop. Vivian Chow and Pedro Rivera / KTLA 2. A shooter killed three women and left four injured on Saturday morning in Beverly Crest, a posh neighborhood near Beverly Hills. Law enforcement responding to multiple 911 calls in the early hours of the morning found the three women dead in a car outside of a “short-term rental” home. Rebecca Gutierrez and Julia Paskin / LAist 3. Some University of California campuses may consider reducing graduate student admissions in order to fund the pay raises negotiated by last semester’s strikers. Critics say that move could have drastic implications for the UC’s teaching and research missions, though the university is yet to coordinate any system-wide plan to pay for the raises. Teresa Watanabe / Los Angeles Times 4. Zhao Chunli, the Half Moon Bay shooter, told investigators that a $100 repair bill for heavy construction equipment damage drove him to allegedly shoot and kill seven people at two mushroom farms. Zhao said he shot a supervisor and a co-worker whom he thought were responsible for a collision between a forklift and bulldozer he was asked to pay for. Lisa Bonos and Joyce Lau / The Washington Post 5. The Los Angeles International Airport’s long-term modernization project is more than halfway complete.

The full union still needs to vote on the contract. Staff / The New York Times 2. California is looking to spend Medicaid funds on housing for the homeless after the Biden administration granted permission for Arizona and Oregon to do so, citing research that showed stable housing improves health. Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed spending some $100 million per year on the program. Adam Beam / Associated Press 3. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Fremont) will co-chair Rep. Barbara Lee’s 2024 Senate campaign, signaling that he’s not interested in running for the upper chamber – or the White House — as some pundits had suspected. The latest polling showed that just 4% of registered California Democrats would have backed a Khanna campaign for the Senate. Nolan D. McCaskill / Los Angeles Times 4. California will stop asking residents to voluntarily cut their water intake after recent storms eased drought fears and replenished the state’s reservoirs. But Newsom was careful to stress that the drought is not over, as water shortages still remain in the Klamath River basin along the California-Oregon border as well as the Colorado River, which serves densely populated Southern California. Adam Beam / Associated Press 5. LA Metro’s board of directors voted to extended its contract with the LA and Long Beach police departments and the county sheriff. The board also expressed interested in forming its own in-house police force, which could in theory allow the transit system to exert more control over the controversial policing practices on its bus and train lines.

Share this with a friend 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A bullet train between LA and Las Vegas got one step closer to reality yesterday when crews broke ground on the $12 billion project. The private company responsible for the effort says the train — which promises to be the first true high-speed rail in the U.S. — will ferry passengers between the cities in just over two hours. The company says the rail could begin operating as soon as 2028 for the Olympics in LA. Edward Russell / The Washington Post 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The majority of a faculty committee meant to support USC’s Muslim community resigned in protest over the university’s decision to cancel this year’s valedictorian address.

No other details were immediately available. Jonathan Park / Daily Trojan 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Pro-Palestinian activists at UC Berkeley erected a tent encampment on the school’s main plaza: a move they say is inspired by student protesters recently arrested at Yale and Columbia. It’s the latest escalation at a college campus that’s seen some of the most bitter conflict in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war, as universities around the country grapple with increasingly fractious demonstrations — and as some Jewish students say they feel increasingly unsafe . Rae Wymer and Aarya Mukherjee / The Daily Californian 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The U.S. Supreme Court seems poised to allow cities to ban homeless people from sleeping in public spaces even when there aren’t any shelter beds available — a ruling that could carry high stakes for California. The case centers around a lower court’s ruling that the small city of Grants Pass, Ore., can’t implement such a ban. Gov. Gavin Newsom and a slate of other California lawmakers have implored the Supreme Court to overturn the ruling, arguing that it hamstrings their efforts to address the state’s homelessness crisis. Jess Bravin / The Wall Street Journal 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Two California lawmakers have reached a rare bipartisan consensus: on airport line cutters. They fucken hate ‘em. A pair of Orange County state senators is promoting a bill that would effectively boot the expedited security service CLEAR — which allows customers to skip to the front of TSA lines for $189 a year — from California airports by requiring that such third-party vendors get their own dedicated TSA lane. The bill’s author said he hopes to rid security checks of the “indignity” of letting “the rich person pass you” in line.

The cash is meant to fund essentials like temporary shelter and medical expenses. Evacuees can apply here after first settling with insurers. Staff / ABC7 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The LA Fire Department chose not to predeploy roughly 1,000 firefighters and over 40 available engines in vulnerable areas before the Palisades fire broke out last week. The revelation adds to a growing blame game as officials accuse one another of bungling the city’s disaster preparation. Staff / Los Angeles Times 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Congressional Republicans have suggested that any wildfire aid to “woke” California should come with “strings attached.” Except, California contributes more income tax than any other state, paying far more than it receives back in federal funding. The aid “can accurately be described as California’s money in the first place,” wrote columnist Philip Bump. Philip Bump / The Washington Post 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The Undergraduate Student Government has an ambitious plan to offer students discounted Waymo rides within USC’s current free Lyft zone.

And now, here are the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. The LA Police Department is investigating three fatal police encounters earlier this month. In two of the cases, police shot and killed the civilians — one of whom was schizophrenic — and in the third, a man died after going into cardiac arrest around four and a half hours after officers tasered him multiple times. Rudy Chinchilla / NBC News 2. President Biden declared an emergency for much of the Bay Area earlier this week, unlocking federal money that can help homes and businesses rebuild after major flooding. Before that money can actually reach Californians, though, federal officials have to assess the damage themselves — which will take some time. Ethan Varian / The Mercury News 3. California’s senators have at times opposed legislation that would regulate firms like Facebook, Apple and Google, which are all headquartered in the state. But it’s starting to look like California’s next senator will likely be tougher on tech giants. Cristiano Lima / The Washington Post 4. Rep. Ro Khanna said he’s weighing a Senate bid. But rumor has it that the Bay Area Democrat could actually be positioning himself for a run on the White House in 2024, seeing as he’s retained consultants with experience in the New Hampshire and Nevada primaries and was previously paying an Iowa firm when the state still boasted first-primary status. Holly Otterbein and Adam Wren / Politico 5. An outbreak of the bird flu that’s killed tens of millions of chickens nationwide has jacked up egg prices in California stores as grocers struggle to stock cartons. Some experts say the shortage won’t go away for another seven or eight months. Staff / Los Angeles Times You’re all caught up. Thanks for reading Morning, Trojan, and have a good day.

Here are the USC, L.A. and California stories you need to know for today. 1. The Los Angeles Police Department is investigating the source of the leaked audio recording that showed city council members making racist remarks. Chief Michael Moore said the investigation was launched at the request of “individuals that were present at that meeting.” Under state law, it’s illegal to record private conversations without the consent of all parties in most cases. Libor Jany, Richard Winton and Connor Sheets / Los Angeles Times 2. The Association of American Universities elected USC President Carol Folt as chair of its board of directors. Folt will now publicly spearhead the association’s projects and act as its leading spokesperson. Benjamin Papp / Daily Trojan 3. The National Weather Service projected another warm and dry winter for large parts of California, along with a persisting or worsening drought. Shrinking reservoirs and a Colorado River crisis have experts sounding the alarm. Diana Leonard / Washington Post 4. Is Gavin Newsom running for President? He denied the claim in Sunday’s gubernatorial debate, but his frequent diversions beyond state borders to launch attack ads against Republican governors in Florida and Texas seem to tell a different story. His aides and advisors still insist that his disinterest in genuine — but some privately acknowledge that a credible run at the White House is becoming more real to him. Alexei Koseff / CalMatters 5. Sheriff’s departments across California stop Black residents at disproportionately high rates, a new report found. In Los Angeles, Black residents were 1.9 times more likely to be stopped by deputies than their white counterparts. Sam Levin / The Guardian 6. A 5.1 magnitude earthquake rattled the Bay Area on Tuesday morning. There were no reports of widespread injury or property damage. Annie Vainshtein, Rachel Swan and Nora Mishanec / San Francisco Chronicle 7. The L.A. City Council elected Curren Price to serve as its president pro tempore on Tuesday, slotting the former state assembly member into the council’s second-in-command role under President Paul Krekorian. Mike Roe and Erin Stone / LAist Nation / world Democrats are bracing for a red wave in the November midterms, as Republicans look increasingly likely to flip both chambers of Congress. ( Axios ) A group of progressive Democrats rescinded a letter that urged President Joe Biden to negotiate directly with Russia to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. ( The Washington Post ) John Fetterman and Mehmet Oz clashed in a hostile Pennsylvania Senate debate Tuesday night. ( The Wall Street Journal ) Adidas dropped its billion-dollar partnership with Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, after his recent spate of antisemitic remarks.

The state education department’s report coincided with a federal report showing similar declines nationwide. Joe Hong and Erica Yee / CalMatters Rick Caruso has closed the gap on Rep. Karen Bass in the Los Angeles mayoral race , gaining ground on what was previously a double-digit deficit in the polls. The likely culprit? Ad money — and lots of it.

How much would the press care if you went missing? This calculator from the Columbia Journalism Review factors your race, sex and location in determining how much media coverage you would get. The calculator isn’t perfect, but it’s a very well done critique of “missing white woman syndrome” in the press. Also, tomorrow is Election Day — get out and vote. And now, here are the stories you need to know for today. 1. Rick Caruso has poured tens of millions of dollars into the unexpectedly tight Los Angeles mayoral race, deploying relentless advertisements and door-to-door canvassers that have helped the businessman close the gap on Rep. Karen Bass. The latest polling showed Bass ahead of Caruso, but within the margin of error. Alexander Nieves / Politico 2. A canvasser for Rep. Jimmy Gomez allegedly made anti-Asian remarks in reference to David Kim, Gomez’s opponent in the race for California’s 34th district which covers part of L.A. County. Gomez’s campaign swiftly denounced and booted the canvasser — saying that the comments weren’t part of an approved campaign script — but that didn’t bottle the ensuing controversy. Josie Huang / LAist 3. Get ready for heavy rain on Monday and Tuesday. The National Weather Service is projecting 1 to 2 inches of rain along the coast and 1.5 to 3 inches in the mountains. Cameron Kiszla / KTLA 4. Opponents of Proposition 1 say the ballot measure could expand California abortion law to allow late-term procedures for any reason — but experts say that isn’t the case. The proposition is a blanket affirmation of abortion access that likely wouldn’t change the status quo. Alexei Koseff / CalMatters 5. Orange County bus maintenance workers agreed to lift their picket lines on Monday in order to get voters to the polls. Tens of thousands of riders in the county found themselves stranded last week when the union went on strike, negotiating for a more favorable wage increase from the county transportation authority. Laura Newberry and Salvador Hernandez / Los Angeles County 6. Did a meteor strike burn down a Northern California home? A Nevada County homeowner said he heard a loud bang and found his porch on fire the same night the Taurid meteor shower was underway; other residents said they saw a bright light shoot across the sky and land in the area near the home immediately before the fire began. Catherine Ho / San Francisco Chronicle 7. 1,300 acres of oceanfront mountain land just northwest of Malibu will soon become a nature preserve. A nonprofit conservation group purchased the property known as Deer Creek Beach for about $25 million with the intention of transferring it to the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. Louis Sahagún / Los Angeles Times Nation / world Democrats are scrambling to appeal to moderate voters in the final stretch before the election, while the GOP seeks to fire up its pro-Trump base.

( BBC ) 19 people died after a plane crashed into Lake Victoria on its way to an airport in Tanzania. ( Los Angeles Times ) Sports Football held down the Golden Bears in a 41-35 win on homecoming night Saturday. It was a classic USC win — a solid night offensively led by Caleb Williams, but with questionable defensive play. (We’ll let that slide because they forced a turnover!) With an earthquake of upsets disrupting college football this weekend, the Trojans still moved up to No. 8 in the AP Poll this week. The Women of Troy put an exclamation point on their soccer season with a 2-0 victory over No. 1 UCLA on Friday. It was a signature performance from graduate goalkeeper Anna Smith, who recorded her sixth clean sheet of the year. While USC came up just short of its first ever Pac-12 title, it will still have an opportunity to make some noise in the NCAA tournament later this month. Women’s volleyball started the week with a much-needed rebound win against Arizona State on Friday, 3-1. On Sunday, the Women of Troy pulled up their sleeves and fought for a five-set come-from-behind victory over the University of Arizona. Down two sets to one, senior outside hitter Skylar Fields delivered a career high 27 kills — her third time reaching that mark this season. USC will welcome the Pac-12-leading Stanford Cardinal to the Galen Center on Wednesday for a 7 p.m. matchup. In pro sports: Los Angeles is on top of the (American) soccer world. LAFC defeated the Philadelphia Union in a penalty-kick shootout to win the MLS Cup on Saturday, after a 3-3 draw in full time. After LAFC’s starting goalkeeper was disqualified on a play that ultimately led him to be carted off the field with leg injury, backup John McCarthy saved two shots in PKs to clinch the organization’s first championship title. The Rams were uprooted by Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 16-13 on Sunday . The Bucs were held without a touchdown until 9 seconds from the end of the game, when Brady connected with tight end Cade Otten to take the lead. At 3-5 on the season, the defending champion Rams are third worst in the league in points scored with only 131. In a more redeemable fashion, the Chargers used late heroics to defeat the Atlanta Falcons 20-17 on Sunday. Rookie kicker Cameron Dicker, who signed with the Bolts just days before the matchup, converted field goals from 31 and 37 yards in the fourth quarter to tie and win the game, respectively.

Gavin Newsom rejected every California local government’s plan to address homelessness, asserting that the “unacceptable” proposals would only reduce homelessness in California by 2% over four years. Big-city mayors said that Newsom’s decision came with little notice and undermined their efforts to curb the statewide crisis. Jeremy White / Politico State Attorney General Rob Bonta isn’t convinced that plastic bag producers are following the law. Per a 2014 senate bill, all plastic bags sold in California are required to be recyclable at in-state facilities; Bonta said that manufactures may be producing products without making sure that the proper recycling infrastructure is in place.

Here are the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. The strike is on. Tens of thousands of LA Unified School District workers start a three-day picket Tuesday morning calling for increased pay and healthcare benefits — among other things. The strike is expected to disrupt learning schedules and vital meal services for 420,000 pupils and their families. Howard Blume / Los Angeles Times 2. A federal judge blocked provisions of a California law that restricted the sale of new handguns on the grounds that it violated the Second Amendment. The ruling leaves other gun safety regulations that limit the sale and use of guns in danger of being struck down, both within California and the rest of the nation. Stefanie Dazio / Associated Press 3. The former Glendale fire chief ordered an underling to distribute the COVID vaccine to city leadership in December 2020 when, at the time, those leaders didn’t qualify for the vaccine, a new lawsuit alleged. The suit also posits that the fire chief sought to curry favor with the leaders and later demoted the underling when he objected to the illegal order. Staff / City News Service 4. LA Police Department administrators accidentally released the names and photos of undercover officers to a watchdog website. The accident — which could jeopardize numerous cartel and counter-terrorism operations, often in concert with federal authorities — was part of a data release for a new public database of LAPD officers run by an activist group. Libor Jany and Richard Winton / Los Angeles Times 5. Celebrate. Toast. Cry happy tears of joy. USC will append an additional mandatory $93 transportation fee to next year’s already historic tuition to cover the free Lyft program, LAX shuttle and new free Metro passes on lines immediately surrounding the University Park Campus. No word on whether that means the Lyft program will go back to offering private rides, or who exactly must pay the fee. Cherry Wu / Daily Trojan You’re all caught up.

I hope you’ve been able to get a good start to your week. Here are the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Thousands of LA Unified School District workers could soon go on strike if contract negotiations don’t yield union calls for wage increases, more full-time work and increased staffing levels. The union represents some 30,000 cafeteria workers, bus drivers, janitors and special education assistants, most of whom rank among the lowest paid employees in the district. Clara Harter / Los Angeles Daily News 2. California lawmakers will attempt to rescind Proposition 8, a 2008 voter-approved initiative that banned the state from recognizing same-sex marriages. The proposition, which is still technically on the books, was an anachronism by 2015 when the U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage — but lawmakers fear it could become a liability if the court’s conservative supermajority revisits the matter. Sophie Austin / Associated Press 3. Mega-fires across California are effectively gentrifying rural communities and exacerbating an already dire housing crisis. Wildfires invariably jack up home prices when they torch an already limited housing stock and similarly bump up fire insurance rates; residents who can’t afford to rebuild after the damage are often forced to leave and never return. Scott Wilson / The Washington Post 4. State park officials are “cautiously optimistic” about the chances of super blooms across California, a rare phenomenon where wild blossoms cover desert regions during wet seasons that follow extended dry periods. Peak season in LA County is mid-March to early April, though officials across the state have begun restricting access to some sites in order to avoid large crowds destroying natural habitats. Jessica Flores / San Francisco Chronicle 5. Mountain lion cubs Holly and Hazel at the Oakland Zoo are quickly becoming California’s newest wildlife darlings after the death of LA’s famous cougar, P-22. The two cubs arrived at the zoo just weeks apart from the Santa Cruz Mountains and were quickly treated for dehydration, malnutrition, severe muscle loss and anemia.

It’s Tuesday, and we’re getting excited about California’s northern lights . Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. A bipartisan group of lawmakers from Nevada and California called on the Biden administration to fast-track funds for a private company to build a high-speed rail line connecting LA and Las Vegas. Electric-powered trains could potentially cut the travel time in half, carrying passengers at speeds of nearly 200 mph. Ken Ritter / Associated Press 2. A rogue shower head in Birnkrant Residential College flooded adjacent dorm rooms and seeped water through the bathroom floor and into the building’s lobby. Separately, Everybody’s Kitchen, the dining hall next to Birnkrant, will be closed for several days while maintenance crews fix a clogged drainpipe. The two incidents are unrelated. Zack Lara / Daily Trojan 3. Two San Bernardino police officers who shot and killed a Black man last July had histories of alleged excessive force. One shot a minor who was holding a gun and failed to quickly summon medical assistance. The other allegedly beat a suspect who was already on the ground following orders, then pressured him to lie about how he sustained his injuries. Both officers’ names were released for the first time just this week. Staff / LAist 4. Gov. Gavin Newson announced that he’ll allocate more than $690 million to fund 28 public transportation projects in disadvantaged communities across areas including San Diego, Sacramento and Santa Cruz. The new funding will conclude the first step in a state initiative to expand passenger rail service throughout California. Iman Palm / KTLA 5. The Oakland Unified School District is on the verge of a strike. Its teachers union is seeking to imitate a maneuver pulled off by its LA counterpart in March, alleging that the school district is engaging in bad-faith negotiating practices — a move that could let the union fast-track its way to a strike. The school district, which is California’s 11th largest, is seeking an injunction claiming that the union is not following procedural steps and that the strike would be illegal.

It’s Thursday, and I’m reading about how Los Angeles animal shelters urgently need people to adopt rabbits . Onto the five USC, LA and California stories you need to know for today. Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A new California bill would cut state funding to colleges that give admission preference to children of alumni and donors — otherwise known as legacy admissions. If passed, the legislation would bar those schools from participating in the Cal Grant program, which provides need-based financial aid for students at both public and private institutions. This isn’t the first time state lawmakers have tried such a move, but it is the first time since the Supreme Court tossed affirmative action and thus renewed progressive efforts to scrap legacy preferences. At USC, where legacy admits account for 14.4% of the sophomore class, students have in past years benefited from something to the tune of $25 million in Cal Grant aid. Teresa Watanabe / Los Angeles Times 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Gov. Gavin Newsom pushed for an exemption in a California fast food wage law that benefits one of his longtime billionaire donors. The law, which will take effect in April, will raise the minimum wage at fast food chains from $16 to $20 an hour. But it carries an oddly specific carve-out: Chains that bake and sell bread a la carte are exempt from the wage requirement. Newsom’s donor owns two dozen Panera Bread franchises in the state, and the exemption will spare him from skyrocketing labor costs come April. Republicans were quick to call for an investigation. Staff / Bloomberg 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Students at UC Santa Barbara posted signs reading “Zionists NOT WELCOME” and “Stay away from our kitchen too!” at the campus’s multicultural center ahead of a Shabbat meal that was scheduled for this weekend. Another read “You can run but you can’t hide Tessa Veksler!” referring to the school’s student government president, who’s Jewish. California colleges seem to have reached a boiling point over the Israel-Hamas war this week. On Tuesday, a San Jose State University professor was put on leave after twisting the arm of a pro-Palestinian protester. And as reported yesterday, anti-Israel demonstrators at UC Berkeley shattered a window and roughed up Jewish students attending a guest lecture by an Israeli lawyer. Margaux Lovely / Santa Barbara Independent 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Napa County may be the first in the U.S. to have all its municipalities ban new gas stations, thanks to a grassroots effort led by high schoolers. Oil industry advocates contend that the bans, which have gained momentum in LA and Sacramento, will only drive up fuel costs. But activists say it’s time to end investments in fossil fuel infrastructure as the state’s 2035 phase-out of gas-powered cars looms close — and that gas stations are increasingly irrelevant pollution-spewing facilities that often leak fuel and toxic vapors. Kate Yoder / Grist 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A California woman who was the oldest person in the U.S. died last week. Edith Ceccarelli, 116, was born in the Northern California town of Willits in 1908 — a time when stagecoaches were still in regular use. Ceccarelli spent most of her life in Willits, where the mayor called her a “local celebrity” and her birthdays were celebrated with public parades and lunches. She was also known to love dancing. At age 104, she took out an ad in the local paper soliciting a new dance partner, writing: “What is nicer than holding a lovely lady in your arms and dancing a beautiful waltz or two-step together?” Jillian D&#39;Onfro / SFGate"},{"slug":"lawmakers-want-to-ban-e-bikes-for-kids","title":"Lawmakers want to ban e-bikes for kids","date":1707926400000,"web_exclusive":false,"content":".bh__byline_wrapper .bh__byline_social_wrapper .bh__byline_social_wrapper > * + * @media (min-width: 768px) .bh__byline_social_wrapper } Lawmakers want to ban e-bikes for kids Tomo Chien February 14, 2024 p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Good morning. It’s Wednesday, and I’m looking at this handy California voter guide with key election dates and information about every ballot measure and candidate for U.S. Congress and the state Legislature. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] California lawmakers want to ban kids from riding e-bikes. Two separate bills take different approaches: One would bar anybody under 12 from operating an e-bike and require people without a drivers license to pass a safety course, while the other would set an age minimum of 16 to operate a bike capable of going over 20 mph. Kids dying in e-bike crashes have made headlines in the past, but the data shows that they’re actually less likely to get into crashes than adults. “Before we get to the state of saying who can ride an e-bike or not, we need to be sure this is a real problem,” said one advocate who opposes both bills. Noah Baustin / The San Francisco Standard 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] If you’re planning to DoorDash a romantic meal or take a Lyft to your date tonight, make sure you have a backup plan. Some drivers for Uber, Lyft and DoorDash plan to stage a multi-city work stoppage today to demand higher compensation and more pay transparency. The gig workers, of course, aren’t unionized, so it’s not entirely clear how disruptive the walkout will be. An Uber spokesperson said previous stoppages haven’t impacted services at all, and last year’s Valentine’s Day strike actually saw an increase in trips. Suhauna Hussain / Los Angeles Times 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Donald Trump launched into an online diatribe against Rep. Adam Schiff, the leading candidate for California’s U.S. Senate seat, calling him a “SLIMEBALL,” “PENCIL NECK” and “LOWLIFE” who’ll screw over California after winning what he implied will be a fraudulent election. Good for him. But Trump notably still hasn’t endorsed Steve Garvey, the former LA Dodgers star who’s the only Republican in the race. It might have something to do with the fact that Garvey has been cagey about whether he’ll vote for Trump a third time come November — he called it a “ personal ” decision when pressed in the first Senate debate — and it’s not even clear whether he’d accept such an endorsement. Charlie Nash / Mediaite 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Police safely recovered the 4-year-old boy whose abduction was broadcast on an AMBER Alert last night, but the suspect is still at large. The boy, Justin Chan, was in the backseat of his father’s car, which he left running while dropping off a DoorDash delivery in Long Beach. The suspect then hopped into the driver’s seat and drove off, later being spotted by two good Samaritans who phoned the authorities. By the time officers found the car, the suspect had fled and Chan was unharmed. Vivian Chow / KTLA 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The FBI is seeking “any and all documents” from Napa County related to some of the region’s most famous wineries, but it’s not clear why. The one notable connection that the 40 individuals and businesses share is that they have ties to embattled county supervisor Alfredo Pedroza, who was at the center of a yearslong controversy when he voted to approve a vineyard that could’ve benefited his father-in-law’s adjacent property without disclosing the conflict of interest. One vintner said he was “baffled” and “mad as hell” that his name is listed in connection with an FBI investigation — “unless I’ve done something wrong that I don’t know about.” Esther Mobley and Jess Lander / San Francisco Chronicle"},{"slug":"lax-picket-homelessness-catalytic-converter-theft-and-more","title":"LAX picket, homelessness, catalytic converter theft and more.","date":1664290562000,"web_exclusive":false,"content":"*|MC_PREVIEW_TEXT|* View this email in your browser Morning, Trojan. Seven stories for today, Sept. 27 📍 On campus The Business of Cinematic Arts major is getting a refresh, and will now issue diplomas with credentials from both Marshall and the School of Cinematic Arts. Students can apply directly for the joint degree from the Common App. ( Staff report / Annenberg Media ) 🌴 In L.A. Three housing agencies tasked with reducing homelessness in the L.A. area failed to spend some $150 million in federal grants between 2015 and 2020, instead returning the money to the federal government. Officials blamed the lack of spending on the federal government’s “rigid” and “complex” funding system that makes it challenging to spend funds quickly or reallocate money that can’t be used for its original purpose. ( City News Service ) Separately, the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority came under fire for a dubious homelessness count which asserted that no unsheltered people live in the northwest quarter of Venice, an area notorious for its homeless crisis. (Doug Smith / Los Angeles Times) United Airlines flight attendants plan to picket at LAX on Tuesday, asserting that staff shortages often leave them stranded for hours waiting to know when they’ll head out for their next flight, and that a company hotline often puts them on hold for more than four hours to find flight and hotel information. ( Kevin Smith / San Gabriel Valley Tribune ) Two L.A. Police Department officers testified that they saw colleagues ogling a photo of what they thought at the time depicted a topless LAPD captain, with some making disparaging comments. The officers testified on behalf of Capt. Lillian Carranza, who in a lawsuit alleged that the department didn’t do enough to tamp down on the circulation of a fake nude photo of her. Chief Michel Moore testified that he thought putting out a statement confirming that Carranza was not the woman depicted in the photo would only generate more curiosity within the department. ( Bill Hetherman / City News Service ) 🌅 California A UC system housing crisis has forced campuses to pack dorm halls and reject thousands of student housing applications, leading some to live in recreational vehicles or take on multiple jobs and loans to make rent. ( Teresa Watanabe / Los Angeles Times ) California recyclers are now only allowed to buy catalytic converters from authorized sellers, as part of a bill signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom that hopes to tamp down on catalytic converter theft. Previously, the Los Angeles Times reported that Toyota Priuses in the western United States were falling victim to catalytic converter theft at a far higher rate than other vehicles. ( Tori Gaines / KTLA ) 🚨 In case you missed it A new study found that a fault system running along the coast of L.A. and Orange counties has the potential to trigger a magnitude 7.8 earthquake. The Harvard study found that the Palos Verdes fault zone, previously thought to be a network of smaller faults, could produce a quake comparable to one from the more well-known San Andreas fault.

Starting in tennis, the duo of sophomore Grace Piper and graduate student Nathalie Rodilosso defeated LMU tandem junior Stefania Rogozinska-Dzik and Isabella Tcherkes-Zade in the Women of Troy Invitational tournament on Sunday. The day prior, the program won seven matches, including singles wins from Piper, sophomore McKenna Koenig and sophomore Sloane Morra. On the pitch, women’s soccer put away Arizona State 2-1 Sunday afternoon. Both goals came from senior midfielder Croix Bethune in the first half — just six minutes apart from each other. The No. 8 Women of Troy continue to prove time and time again that they can hang with the best of the best in college soccer. The 8-2-1 squad will have just under a month to gain enough momentum before facing No. 1 ranked UCLA to end the regular season. Until then, a formidable 8-3-3 Berkeley team awaits the squad next Friday. In volleyball, senior outside hitter Skylar Fields scorched the Sun Devils with a career-high 27 kills yesterday, en route to a 3-1 victory over ASU . The University of Texas, Austin transfer has had her name called upon plenty this season, quantified by 715 attempts (second on the team is freshman Jordan Wilson, with 383). In addition to her scoring clinic, Fields contributed on defense with 12 digs and a solo block. It’s Pac-12 opponents from here on out for the Women of Troy, the next up being University of Oregon (10-4, 4-2) on Friday at the Galen Center. (Photo by Tomoki Chien / Annenberg Media) The Trojan offense was able to overwhelm Washington State on Saturday , erasing a short-lived deficit and earning the football program’s sixth win in a row, 30-14. Lincoln Riley has gone to the well more frequently, giving redshirt senior Travis Dye important carries during the win streak. The Norco product has at least 100 rushing yards and a touchdown in four of his past five games. Something to monitor before USC faces No. 20 Utah next weekend: Caleb Williams and his inconsistent play of late. The Trojans signal caller posted his second sub-70 quarterback rating game in the past three games. Last season, Williams only had two performances of that nature in eight full games played at the University of Oklahoma (vs. No. 13 Baylor and No. 7 Oklahoma State). In perhaps the most dominant fashion of any USC team this weekend, men’s water polo routed San Jose State 18-7 on Saturday. Eleven different Trojans scored on offense, and defense was just as apparent, holding the Spartans to 23% shooting. USC is gearing up for an away game at Berkeley on Saturday. The Collegiate Water Polo Association recently ranked Cal No. 2 and USC No. 5 in its latest poll; next week’s game will certainly cause a major shift in those positions. ⭐️ A bonus Check out this cheeky headline written by my boss Christina Chkarboul at the Daily Trojan on family weekend festivities. 🚨 In case you missed it The Rylan Report, news commentary, advice for student journalists and more.

Most affected faculty were adjunct assistant professors. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] It is difficult to compile a precise breakdown of USC’s layoffs, which have been announced at staggered intervals over the last two months and rarely with specific numbers. Additional headcount reductions are widely expected in the next few weeks. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Known affected schools and units include: Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism (13) Athletics (6) Department of Contracts and Grants (unknown) Fire Safety and Emergency Planning (unknown) Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry (unknown) IT Services (24) Keck healthcare system (89) Libraries (11) Mann School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences (unknown) Office of Cybersecurity (unknown) Price School of Public Policy (unknown) Rossier School of Education (19) Roski School of Art and Design (unknown) School of Cinematic Arts (5) Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work (unknown) University Communications (13) Viterbi School of Engineering (55; more to come) p span[style*=\"font-size\"] View the latest WARN notice here . p span[style*=\"font-size\"] This blurb is only published on our live tracker.

It’s unclear if the school plans to order more layoffs. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] SCA laid off five employees in technical departments, according to a source with firsthand knowledge of the matter. Rossier laid off four faculty and 15 staff members, according to an email sent by Dean Pedro Noguera. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “These are very difficult decisions, and we understand how hard this news is for our community,” Noguera wrote. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Additional layoffs were reported at USC’s schools of social work, pharmacy, and art and design, though it’s unclear how many employees were affected. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] This blurb is only published on our live tracker.

The Wednesday layoff at University Communications affected 13. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Other affected units since the onset of USC’s layoffs in July include Annenberg, the Keck healthcare system, athletics, and the Office of Cybersecurity. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] More are expected to come this month.

In response to a question about her compensation, Dean Willow Bay said she took a “reduction in service” to lower her salary, but did not provide further details. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Read more at Annenberg Media. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Layoff: 89 Keck employees | Aug. 7, 2025 p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC’s Keck healthcare system laid off 89 employees Monday, marking the largest workforce reduction yet amid the university’s ongoing budget crisis, according to state labor documents. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] More layoffs are expected throughout the month as schools and non-academic units contend with drastic budget cuts . p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “Despite our best efforts, we were unable to avoid layoffs,” Keck executives wrote in a Tuesday memo to employees. “This tough decision is one of several we are making to stabilize the finances of Keck Medicine and the Keck School, and to ensure economic stability.” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] State labor documents show that none of the affected employees, whose layoffs are effective Oct. 4, work at the Keck School of Medicine. The executives wrote that they expect to complete most layoffs in the school and healthcare system by the end of the week. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Interim President Beong-Soo Kim wrote in a July 14 memo that USC’s budget crisis is in part due to the healthcare system’s poor revenue.

Affected employees will leave in September. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Many worked at the university’s Office of Cybersecurity, which the Daily Trojan reported is undergoing a departmental reorganization. Other affected employees include a hospitality director, marketing administrator, costume shop manager, and development officer. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Two sources involved in high-level discussions said the 55 are likely only the start of a mass culling expected in the coming weeks.

Inpatient care at the geropsychiatric unit will continue to operate as usual, the memo says. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] This blurb is only published on our live tracker.

The school has thus far avoided cutting any sports teams, unlike other universities across the country. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Read more at Los Angeles Times. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Sizable layoffs are coming, sources warn | June 29, 2025 p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC still hasn’t publicly announced the imminent sweeping budget cuts that Morning, Trojan reported on June 28.

One grant would’ve funded an architecture professor’s book. Another funded a Chinatown history project. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “This really is symptomatic of the Trump administration’s attack on intellectual life,” said professor Ginger Nolan. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Read more at Daily Trojan. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Cut: Ph.D. offers | March 27, 2025 p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Multiple USC doctoral programs are rescinding Ph.D. admission offers because of “uncertainty” in federal funding and the school’s ongoing financial woes, according to memos obtained by Morning, Trojan and university sources familiar with the matter. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Read more at Morning, Trojan. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Cuts: Hiring freeze, permanent budget reductions, and more | March 24, 2025 p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC ordered an extraordinary set of budget reductions that include a near-total staff hiring freeze and a pause on employee raises — the latest symptoms of the university’s recent financial woes. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The school cited “federal funding uncertainty” and its operating deficit for the mandate. The official list of cuts, though, is boring, dry, and confusing to most people who speak normal English. See our simplified list: Permanent Budget Reductions: Last year, USC told academic and administrative departments to cut a total of $127 million in annual spending — but it was unclear how long that would last. Now we know it’s permanent. Procurement Control: If you’re a USC employee who wants to spend more than $50,000 on outside goods or services — lab equipment, furniture, janitors, etc. — you’ll have to get approval from the school’s most senior financial officials. Capital Spending Slowdown: The school is rethinking its big, long-term projects and might pause some of them. Those could include the still-unfinished Capital Campus or the planned research hub at the Health Sciences Campus. Staff Hiring Freeze: USC will stop hiring new staff, with a few “critical exceptions.” Faculty Hiring Curtailment: The school won’t order a total stop on faculty hiring, but it will “significantly” restrict it. It’s unclear what that actually means. Discretionary Spending Restrictions: Want to travel to that conference? Throw an office holiday party? Fuck you. We’re not funding it. Enhanced Efficiency: This item doesn’t really mean anything. No Merit Pool for Faculty and Non-Hospital Staff: You’re not going to get a raise this year. Sunset of Extended Winter Recess: Employees now have a shorter winter break. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] This blurb is only published on our live tracker.

The paring back of merit aid could leave the university with fewer tools to woo the nation’s top college applicants. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Read more at Morning, Trojan. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Cut: Scholarships for National Merit Finalists | Dec. 23, 2024 p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC dramatically reduced a merit scholarship it offers for students who earn elite scores on their high school PSAT exams. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Students who currently receive the scholarship will not be affected by the roughly 43% reduction, a university spokesperson said. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Read more at Morning, Trojan. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Cut: Daily Trojan staff stipends | Dec. 16, 2024 p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The Daily Trojan can no longer afford to pay its staff or produce a daily print paper thanks to a significant budget cut, according to an internal announcement obtained by Morning, Trojan. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The paper, whose editorial operation is run by students but funded by USC, has historically paid its writers some $15 per story. Print production will now run three days a week rather than five. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Read more at Morning, Trojan. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC warns it’ll order more cuts thanks to operating deficit | Nov. 20, 2024 p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC said it must order a series of budget cuts after running on a $158 million operating deficit last fiscal year. The school blamed — among other things — inflation, declining graduate enrollment, and rising athletic expenses for the shortfall. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “Difficult decisions are going to have to be made,” the provost said in a contentious faculty senate meeting. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Read more at Annenberg Media , or see the official announcement . p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Cut: Tuition benefits for children of employees | Oct. 29, 2024 p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC significantly cut key benefits that pay college tuition for the children of faculty and staff, according to interviews and documents obtained by Morning, Trojan. It later partially walked back its decision. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “It’s truly seismic,” said James Moore, a professor emeritus who was present at a Faculty Senate meeting where the cuts were presented. “They’re going to go absolutely apeshit.” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Read more at Morning, Trojan. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Layoff: Fundraising communicators | September 2024 p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC laid off the vast majority of its Advancement Communications team, according to internal memos obtained by Morning, Trojan. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Those personnel were responsible for building and maintaining relationships with the university’s private donors. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A USC official wrote to staffers in a September email that the Advancement Communications department would transition to a “restructured team” with the university’s central communications staff. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Just five of 14 staffers who reapplied for roles were offered new positions, according to an employee familiar with the matter. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] This blurb is only published on our live tracker.

Share this with a friend 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The best restaurant in the country is right next to USC, according to Yelp’s annual power list that uses a combination of ratings and expert opinion. Holbox (pronounced “hol-bosh”), which recently earned a Michelin star, offers ceviche to die for and “sublime” fish tacos at a surprisingly affordable price. Staff / Yelp 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] UCLA suspended two pro-Palestinian student groups after masked activists descended on a Jewish UC regent’s home, smeared his walls with painted handprints, then surrounded his wife while she was in her car. “Damn that’s crazy… 😏” one of the groups wrote on Instagram after the suspension. Jaweed Kaleem / Los Angeles Times 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] LA officials issued evacuation warnings for burn scar areas from the Palisades and Eaton fires, anticipating mudslides and flash floods. An atmospheric river is expected to douse parts of the region with as much as 1 inch of rain per hour today; the threshold for debris flow in burn scars is half an inch. Jacob Margolis / LAist 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The Northern California city of Fremont passed a sweeping law that criminalizes homeless encampments and threatens anybody “aiding, abetting or concealing” them with up to six months behind bars. Critics characterized the law as a draconian policy that effectively makes feeding homeless people a misdemeanor. Garrett Leahy / The San Francisco Standard 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A California appeals court ruled that a Bakersfield baker violated the law when she refused to make a wedding cake for a lesbian couple. The case, which is likely headed to the state Supreme Court, echoes a nearly identical Colorado incident where the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of the baker after finding that state officials acted with prejudice.

Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Anti-abortion activist Lydia Taylor Davis visited campus yesterday for her “Abortion is Violence” tour. After Charlie Kirk’s rowdy visit , she seemed liable to draw a crowd … except only, like, six people talked to her. “It was a lot,” said freshman Huckleberry Young. “I kind of got roped into that.” Sydnie McClain and Benjamin Gamson / Annenberg Media 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A suspected gang-related shooting at the corner of Vermont Avenue and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard left three people injured around 4:10 p.m. yesterday. Two 16-year-old boys are stable in the hospital, and a woman in her 50s is in critical condition. Police are searching for two teenagers who they say shot the victims then fled. Clara Harter / Los Angeles Times 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The California DMV routinely fails to revoke licenses from drivers with horrifying histories of reckless and dangerous driving, a CalMatters investigation found. Drivers often retain licenses after DUIs, crashes, and numerous tickets. Some of those drivers go on to kill people. Sometimes, they go on to kill a second person. Robert Lewis / CalMatters 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Harvard University unequivocally rejected the Trump administration’s preposterous demands in an enviable display of a backbone — then was promptly rewarded with a $2 billion funding freeze. “The university will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,” President Alan Garber wrote. Vimal Patel / The New York Times 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A homeless man in San Luis Obispo won $1 million from a lottery scratcher. The odds of winning such a prize are 1 in 2,047,423. “I just can’t wait to get off the streets,” the unidentified man said in a viral video , whose caption noted that he and his wife have been homeless “for a long time.” Kaytlyn Leslie / The Tribune"},{"slug":"lyft-bans-alleged-rapist","title":"Lyft bans alleged rapist","date":1699459216000,"web_exclusive":false,"content":"*|MC_PREVIEW_TEXT|* View this email in your browser By Tomoki Chien Good morning. It’s Wednesday, and I’m reading about how an AirBnb “tenant from hell” finally moved out of a Brentwood guesthouse after refusing to pay rent for 570 days. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. Content warning: This newsletter includes discussion of sexual assault and suicide. 1. Lyft confirmed that the man who allegedly raped a USC student last week was in fact working for the rideshare platform and has been permanently banned. The company previously said it couldn’t confirm the alleged perpetrator was one of its drivers. Other details were still scarce: The LA Police Department didn’t clarify whether it has made an arrest, and said the investigation is ongoing. Talia Wexler / Daily Trojan 2. Four current and former LA Sheriff’s Department employees died by suicide in a 24-hour span this week, prompting a plea from Sheriff Robert Luna for deputies to check on the well-being of their colleagues. Studies have shown that, in recent years, more police officers have died by suicide than those killed in the line of duty: a problem some experts attributed to the stresses of the job, recent public scrutiny and easy access to firearms. Libor Jany and Richard Winton / Los Angeles Times 3. The pro-Palestinian demonstrator involved in a confrontation with a Jewish man who died after a Thousand Oaks protest called 911 and cared for him while awaiting first responders, police said. Authorities are still piecing together what happened. The coroner said 69-year-old Paul Kessler died of a head injury consistent with the backward fall witnesses reported, but it’s unclear whether he fell as a direct result of the confrontation. Police warned the public not to jump to any conclusions before the investigation is complete. Stefanie Dazio and Julie Watson / Associated Press 4. More than 1,000 maintenance workers in the California State University system will strike for one day next Tuesday, a move that’s expected to halt all work orders across 22 of CSU’s 23 campuses. The union accused the university system of failing to bargain in good faith just a week after a separate union of professors, lecturers, librarians and coaches authorized — but didn’t actually call — a strike. Maya Miller / The Sacramento Bee 5. LA County plans to reuse sediment scooped out of flood control channels and dams to augment beaches losing their sand to erosion. The Board of Supervisors, which unanimously approved the proposal, will seek state and federal grants to fund the effort. The dredged sediment currently gets trucked to the Angeles National Forest or dumped in gravel pits and regional landfills. Steve Scauzillo / Los Angeles Daily News You’re all caught up.

Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. A majority of California voters oppose cash reparations for descendants of enslaved African Americans, a UC Berkeley poll found, suggesting a tough road ahead for the effort to adopt a first-in-the-nation reparations policy. Despite the fact that a majority of voters said they believe Black Americans continue to be affected by the legacy of slavery, only 23% said they supported cash payments — compared to 59% who opposed them and 13% who had no opinion. Adrian Florido / NPR 2. The state Legislature is considering a bill that would pilot a guaranteed transfer program for community college students to UCLA, taking a piecemeal approach to the eventual goal of a common admissions guarantee for community college students at both University of California and California State University campuses. The bill is a salvaged version of a scrapped original effort that would’ve created a UC-wide transfer guarantee. Mikhail Zinshteyn / CalMatters 3. Fast food workers in California could earn a minimum wage of $20 per hour by April, thanks to a deal cut between labor groups and fast food companies. The wage increase is contingent upon labor groups and their allies in the Legislature scrapping a provision on the same bill that would’ve made restaurant companies liable for workplace violations committed by their franchisees. Santul Nerkar / The New York Times 4. California lawmakers voted to lift a six-year ban on state-funded travel to 26 states with anti-LGBTQ+ policies Monday. Legislators said that the ban led to unintended consequences like complicating the state’s policy to pay travel fees for people seeking abortions in California and difficulty for college sports teams, state workers and university employees to procure funding for travel to the banned states. Alternatively, the Legislature will promote awareness and anti-discrimination through ad campaigns in red states. Tran Nguyen / Associated Press 5. San Francisco is seeing a troubling rise in building fires, reaching a 10-year high for residential and commercial blazes last year. It’s not clear what exactly is responsible for the trend. Some experts say the increasing prevalence of synthetic materials in construction and furniture is leading fires to spread faster than they did 40 years ago. City officials pointed to the fact that many buildings were built before new sprinkler system requirements and thus don’t have modern fire suppression systems.

Here are the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Authorities arrested a 65-year-old man in connection to the killing of David G. O’Connell, an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles found dead with at least one gun shot wound in his home on Saturday. Security footage linked Carlos Medina — the arrested suspect and husband of O’Connell’s housekeeper — to the scene. Michael Levenson and Christine Chung / The New York Times 2. USC graduate student workers secured a milestone victory Friday, winning the right to unionize and engage in collective bargaining with the university. A decisive 93% of the 1,721 ballots cast were in favor of unionization. All teaching assistants, assistant lecturers, research assistants, students funded through training grants and fellows in STEM disciplines are eligible to join the union. Tomoki Chien / Daily Trojan 3. Federal prosecutors charged 28-year-old Jaime Tran with hate crimes Friday after they say he shot two Jewish men walking home from LA synagogues in separate incidents. Both shootings were nonfatal, but nonetheless left the Jewish community reeling after a spate of anti-semitic rhetoric last fall and as the shadow of the Monterey Park shooting still looms over the city. Rachel Treisman and Giulia Heyward / NPR 4. California Assemblymember Mia Bonta — wife of state Attorney General Rob Bonta — recused herself from matters pertaining to the Department of Justice as part of her role chairing the subcommittee that oversees her husband’s budget. The Bontas had previously faced backlash for the arrangement. Staff / Associated Press 5. Gov. Gavin Newsom blindsided UCLA officials last month when he directed the university to implement a guaranteed community college transfer program — or else lose $20 million in state funding. Since then, critics have been left questioning why Newson would single out UCLA and whether a guaranteed admission program based on grades will actually be in service of equitable admissions.

A man attacked Paul Pelosi — husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi — with a hammer in the couple’s San Francisco home on Friday. The suspected assailant, who is in custody, was carrying zip ties when he broke into the residence. Paul Pelosi was hospitalized and underwent a successful surgery to repair a skull fracture. Staff / San Francisco Chronicle 2. Former President Barack Obama endorsed Rep. Karen Bass’ Los Angeles mayoral campaign. Obama’s support adds to a string of other prominent Democratic endorsements from the likes of President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and Nancy Pelosi, among others. Kat Schuster / Patch 3. In-person voting has begun at more than 100 voting centers across L.A. County. You can still vote even if you aren’t registered yet — just ask for a conditional voter registration application at any voting location, including ones within walking distance of USC. Matthew Ballinger / Los Angeles Times 4. Who’s the real USC? The University of South Carolina certainly isn’t backing down, announcing a rebrand that includes retiring its “UofSC” logo in favor of a familiar block-letter “USC” replacement. The Carolina school has clashed with its West Coast counterpart over copyright law in the past. Christina Chkarboul / Daily Trojan 5. Advocates are proposing a new Chuckwalla National Monument that would preserve almost 700,000 desert acres adjacent to Joshua Tree National Park. The proposal would need a presidential order or a green light from Congress to become reality. Monserrat Solis / Los Angeles Daily News 6. An 8-year-old boy made the news for purportedly becoming the youngest person to scale Yosemite’s El Capitan. But experts in the climbing community have called the claim a “hoax,” alleging that the boy and his father ascended the famous granite monolith using a method that doesn’t qualify as rock climbing. Gregory Thomas / San Francisco Chronicle 7. Pasadena’s Rose Bowl stadium officially turned 100 years old. Perhaps the stadium’s newly minted centenarian status will boost UCLA’s home football game attendance. (Not.) Staff / Pasadena Star-News Nation / world More than 150 people died after a Halloween stampede in Seoul. ( The Washington Post ) It wasn’t just Pelosi: Politically motivated violence is on the rise across the country, stemming from what experts have called incendiary rhetoric from prominent politicians — particularly on the right. ( Los Angeles Times ) The Supreme Court will consider challenges to race-conscious admissions policies at Harvard and the University of North Carolina starting Monday, potentially reducing the scope of the historic Brown v. Board of Education decision. ( The New York Times ) Leftist Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva defeated incumbent Jair Bolsonaro in the Brazilian presidential race, although Bolsonaro has yet to concede. ( Associated Press ) At least 141 people died after a pedestrian suspension bridge collapsed in India, which has many questioning whether authorities performed proper safety checks on the recently repaired bridge. ( BBC ) Sports Football is back in the win column after a 45-37 shootout against Arizona. Caleb Williams was phenomenal, passing for 411 yards and 5 touchdowns. Even without their top two receivers, star linebacker and starting left guard, the Trojans kept their Pac-12 Championship — and College Football Playoff — aspirations alive. Back from an underwhelming road trip, women’s soccer rebounded nicely with a 2-1 win against Washington on Thursday and a 3-2 victory over Washington State on Sunday. In yesterday’s game, sophomore forward Simone Jackson scored the go-ahead, unassisted goal in the 64th minute to put the Trojans ahead for good. USC’s regular season will come to a close with a home match against No. 1 UCLA Friday at 2 p.m. Men’s water polo blew the Cardinal out of the water with a 19-14 win on Sunday. Redshirt senior Jake Ehrhardt led the match with 5 goals, while redshirt senior Ashworth Molthen supplied an additional 4 goals and 4 assists. With its alumni game set for Saturday and regular season finale against UCLA on Nov. 11, the fun is far from over for USC. In pro sports: The Rams were uprooted by the San Francisco 49ers 31-14 on Sunday . I would go as far to say that the Rams simply got outplayed. No turnovers from Matthew Stafford, who threw 22/33 and a touchdown, but the 49ers’ new weapon, Christian McCaffrey scored 3 touchdowns — one each via throwing, running and receiving. LAFC defeated Austin FC 3-0 in the Western Conference championship on Sunday, and is now one win away from hoisting the MLS Cup. The team, founded in 2014, will fight for its first piece of hardware Saturday against the Philadelphia Union. The purple and gold are finally in the win column after a 0-5 start. The Lakers defeated the Denver Nuggets 121-110 on Sunday, thanks to a promising effort from the team’s trio of stars. Other things we’re reading Tomo’s picks: “Can Hypebeast Magic Revive J.

Under state law, it’s fairly easy to launch an initial recall attempt, but triggering an actual election is more difficult — recall backers would likely have to collect some 25,000 signatures in District 14 for that to happen. Julia Wick and Dakota Smith / Los Angeles Times Monkeypox cases in L.A. County continue to decline, likely evidence that vaccines and treatments are protecting against further spread of the virus.

One of two men accused of killing six people “execution-style” in a Tulare County home last month pleaded not guilty. 25-year-old Noah David Beard’s alleged accomplice — 35-year-old Angel Uriarte — remains hospitalized in custody after being wounded in a shootout with federal agents last week. Staff / Associated Press 2. The devastating earthquake in Turkey has hit close to home in California, a state known to be quake-prone. Experts project that a 7.8 magnitude earthquake along the San Andreas Fault could bring a death toll of 1,800, injure another 50,000 and displace up to 1 million people — and that’s just in Southern California. Rong-Gong Lin II / Los Angeles Times 3. LeBron James broke Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s all-time NBA scoring record Tuesday night at the end of the third quarter against the Oklahoma City Thunder. Abdul-Jabbar’s record — 38,387 points — had stood for 39 years, untouched by even the likes of Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant. Sopan Deb and Tania Ganguli / The New York Times 4. The LA City Council adopted an ordinance that requires landlords to cover relocation costs for tenants who move out after rent increases of more than 10%. The move is part of a suite of renter protections the council is seeking to implement after its COVID-era protections expired. Staff / City News Service 5. A pest control technician responding to a work order in a Northern California home discovered an estimated 700 pounds of acorns stored in a wall that woodpeckers had presumably hoarded over multiple years.

A school official insisted the building is “necessary” in order to “compete with the rest of the country” — because, clearly, a 160,000-square-foot cash sinkhole is the solution to the Trojans’ on-field woes.

LA Mayor Karen Bass declared a state of emergency over homelessness, giving her the power to unilaterally direct money to programs and facilities aiming to remedy the crisis. Still, her declaration needs the City Council’s stamp of approval, but the legislative body is so dysfunctional that it might not be able to approve the declaration until mid-January. David Zahniser, Dakota Smith, Benjamin Oreskes, Julia Wick / Los Angeles Times 2. Scientists at a California lab reached a major milestone in developing nuclear fusion, a technology that could dramatically alter the energy landscape. For the first time, the researchers were able to produce more energy from the reaction — which mimics the process that takes place in the sun — than they put into it. Kenneth Chang / The New York Times 3. The U.S. Supreme Court said it won’t overturn California’s ban on flavored tobacco products, a win for anti-teen smoking advocates. Tobacco companies had sought to keep the measure, approved by nearly two-thirds of voters in November, from taking effect. Staff / Associated Press 4. A ransomware attack hit the California Department of Finance. LockBit, a Russian-affiliated group, claimed responsibility for the hack and set a Dec. 24 deadline for the department to pay up or else face a leak of the 76GB of sensitive data that the group claims it has. Romy Varghese and Margi Murphy / Bloomberg 5. Some 200 near-naked San Franciscans donned bright red undies for the 14th annual Santa Skivvies run, a fundraiser for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation.

Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Rep. Kevin McCarthy was ousted from the House speakership by a far-right mutiny, dealing an embarrassing blow to the Bakersfield Republican’s political career and at least temporarily diminishing California’s influence in Washington. Eight hardline Republicans led by Rep. Matt Gaetz — who were ostensibly looking to punish McCarthy for collaborating too often with colleagues across the aisle — joined Democrats to boot the speaker by a 216-210 vote. Erin B. Logan and Cameron Joseph / Los Angeles Times 2. Nearly 20,000 student workers in the California State University system will soon decide whether they’ll unionize, potentially becoming one of the largest student worker unions in U.S. history. The students — who work in places like financial aid offices, information technology departments and front desks — count both graduate and undergraduate students among their ranks. They say they’re primarily looking for higher pay, more hours and sick leave. The students currently make state minimum wage and are restricted to 20 hours a week: in fact the same as USC student workers. Helena San Roque / CalMatters 3. USC dining halls will pilot a program to replace their current compostable takeout containers with reusable stainless steel bowls later this month. The pilot is in partnership with USEFULL, a reusable container company, with the hopes of growing to all campus dining options. Students must return the containers — which are made of two layers of stainless, recyclable steel and a biodegradable silicone lid — within 48 hours or risk fines of $1 per day. Caleb Kim / Daily Trojan 4. California cities could soon be required to cut their water consumption by as much as 20%, regardless of how wet or dry it is, under a work-in-progress state policy. The state could fine violating water agencies as much as $10,000 per day for failing to meet the cuts, though it’ll be up to those agencies to decide how to meet their state-allocated allowance — likely through a mix of traditional conservation encouragement as well as their own fines and requirements of residents. Kurtis Alexander / San Francisco Chronicle 5. A “Ring of Fire” solar eclipse will appear throughout California later this month. On Oct. 14 at 9:13 a.m., the moon will pass between the Earth and the sun, causing an orange glow to surround the shadowed moon. Hopeful viewers looking for an optimal experience ought to use eye protection and view the eclipse from along the path of the annularity, though the daytime darkness should be noticeable from most places.

Share this with a friend 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Conservative gadfly Megyn Kelly says her identity as a woman is being “ scrubbed right out of existence ” because the USC Song Girls rebranded as USC Song Leaders. USC said the name change will help “include all students,” but the former Fox News host retorted that the team might have to start using gender neutral bathrooms. Tomoki Chien / Morning, Trojan 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC inflates tuition for students with divorced or separated parents, a new lawsuit against 40 U.S. colleges alleges. The suit claims that, in a scheme with College Board, the schools unfairly consider assets of noncustodial parents to artificially inflate family income when determining financial aid rewards. Michael T. Nietzel / Forbes 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Riverside County deputies said they thwarted an assassination attempt at Donald Trump’s Saturday rally in Coachella. Cops arrested 49-year-old Vem Miller on suspicion of illegal possession of firearms — and also called him “a lunatic” who claims to be a sovereign citizen. Miller said the accusations were “complete bullshit.” Matthew Ormseth / Los Angeles Times 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Irvine’s police department spent $153,000 on a tricked-out Cybertruck, except it won’t actually be used for patrols.

Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Three New York men are on trial for allegedly conspiring to sell stolen draft lyrics of the 1977 Eagles hit album “Hotel California.” Prosecutors claim that the men — a rare-book dealer, former Rock & Roll Hall of Fame curator and memorabilia seller — bought the allegedly stolen handwritten lyrics from a writer who had worked on a book about the band that was never published. Clashes over music collectibles are fairly common, but such fights spilling into criminal trials like this are rare. What’s even more uncommon is that Don Henley, the band’s star co-founder, is expected to testify in the case between tour stops. He’s not, in other words, taking it easy . David Browne / Rolling Stone 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Yesterday, I wrote about how Russian authorities detained an LA woman on suspicion of treason — but missed a key detail: The charges stem from a donation of just $50 that the woman made to a New York-based charity that aids the Ukrainian military. Ksenia Karelina, a 33-year-old spa aesthetician who’s a dual U.S.-Russia citizen, now faces the full brunt of Vladimir Putin’s increasingly repressive wartime regime. Russian officials said Karelina is accused of “proactively collecting funds … which were subsequently used to purchase tactical medicine items, equipment, weapons and ammunition.” I’m sure her $50 went a long way. Staff / Los Angeles Times 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] California’s budget deficit is expected to balloon by another $15 billion, analysts said. It now sits at $73 billion for the 2024-25 fiscal year. Earlier this year, Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed dipping into state reserves and cutting some short-term programs to cover the original projected shortfall, but it’s unclear what the state’s long-term solution might be; Newsom has rejected the idea of raising taxes or creating new ones to increase revenue. The governor is expected to outline a new budget in May. Sameea Kamal / CalMatters 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] As a massive dam removal project near the California-Oregon border nears completion, an important question remains: Who does the newly emerged land belong to? The native Shasta people — who were exiled from the area partly due to the construction of the dam — are expected to reclaim a stretch of it, according to California officials. Descendants of the Shasta people were never able to regroup after being exiled from the Klamath River area more than a century ago. “We’ve longed for the return to our homelands for such a long time, and now we finally have hope,” said a tribal council secretary for the Shasta Indian Nation. Kurtis Alexander / San Francisco Chronicle 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Chinese pandas are returning to the San Diego Zoo after five years of absence and could arrive as soon as this summer. The bears have long symbolized U.S.-China friendship, dating back to 1972 when Beijing loaned a pair of pandas to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. So when Chinese authorities started pulling pandas on loan to Western nations last year, analysts speculated it was due to deteriorating diplomatic relations with the U.S. The return to San Diego could help reestablish so-called “panda diplomacy.” Julie Watson / Associated Press"},{"slug":"mental-health-a-cyberattack-an-end-to-the-heat-wave-and-more","title":"Mental health, a cyberattack, an end to the heat wave and more.","date":1662562536000,"web_exclusive":false,"content":"*|MC_PREVIEW_TEXT|* View this email in your browser Morning, Trojan.

It’s Monday, and we’re excited that the superbloom is finally here . Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. LA Metro said it turned down the volume of the classical music playing at the Westlake/MacArthur Park Station in response to heated criticism from riders who worried that the music could cause hearing damage. The classical music is part of a pilot program to discourage people from loitering in an effort to address rising crime on the transit lines. Divya Prakash and Payton Seda / LAist 2. Workers returned to Southern California ports Friday night, ending a 24-hour shutdown at the ports of LA and Long Beach — a “concerted action to withhold labor,” as the shippers group described. The union representing West Coast dockworkers is several months into negotiating a new contract that is focused on updating wages and discussing the role of automation in the industry. Marisa Gerber and Ronald D. White / Los Angeles Times 3. The union that represents LA school workers officially agreed to a new contract with the LA Unified School District that will give workers a 30% salary increase, a $1,000 bonus for those who worked during the Covid-19 pandemic, expanded health care benefits and increased hours for special education assistants. Dakin Andone and Rebekah Riess / CNN 4. Since the pandemic began, bouncers in the San Francisco Bay Area have been irked by a nagging problem: Young people are trying to get into bars with photos — not hard copies — of their IDs. Or they flash a Global Entry ID. Or an office ID card. One club owner postulated that people who came of age during the pandemic may never have been taught how bars work. Esther Mobley / San Francisco Chronicle 5. A puppy thrown out the window of a pickup truck during an LA high-speed police chase emerged unscathed. Police were chasing a suspect wanted in connection to an attempted murder and carjacking when someone in the vehicle placed the eight-week-old mixed breed in a designer bag and threw it onto the road.

Anybody with a valid student ID can now ride for free on the Metrolink railway system, which connects essentially all of Southern California between San Diego and Lancaster. The offer extends to students as young as kindergarteners all the way to adults in technical schools, and will run for six months or until grant funding runs out. Riders can get their Student Adventure Pass at any MetroLink ticket machine or register with their student ID in the Metrolink app. Talia Wexler / Daily Trojan 2. Over 100 pro-Palestine demonstrators rallied on campus Tuesday evening in a peaceful protest. The rally came the same day as a strike on a Gaza hospital killed more than 500 people; both Israel and Hamas blamed each other for the attack. Many students covered their faces and declined to provide their names for fear of being doxxed by websites like Canary Mission, which posts the names, photos and biographical information of college students and professors it deems anti-Israel. Victoria Lee / Daily Trojan 3. Los Angeles Unified students are still struggling in math and English after pandemic setbacks, standardized test scores show. Though math scores rose by a modest 2 percentage points over the previous year, 7 in 10 students still fail to meet state standards — and English scores dropped district-wide by half a percentage point. Both categories were below what they were in the 2017-18 school year, underscoring the ongoing struggle to cover learning loss wrought by the pandemic. Howard Blume / Los Angeles Times 4. Rite Aid will close 31 stores in California as part of its restructuring plan after filing for bankruptcy. The pharmacy chain has been troubled by lagging sales and several large settlements in opioid-related lawsuits, posting a $306.7 million loss of revenue in the last year. At least 10 stores in LA County and six in Orange County are marked for closure. None are particularly close to USC. Samantha Gowan / Orange County Register 5. Christina Pascucci, a veteran KTLA news anchor, said she’ll run for California’s Senate seat as a Democrat. The first-time candidate framed herself as a moderate consensus builder focused on issues like the California-Mexico border, education and family support policies like childcare and parental leave.

Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. A mass shooting in Mojave on Sunday night left four men dead. Police said the victims were in their 20s or 30s but have made no arrests and are yet to disclose a possible motive. The Kern County Sheriff’s Office first got the call late Sunday night, so details were scant as of Monday morning. Mojave is a small desert community around 65 miles east of downtown Bakersfield. Luis Garcia / KGET 2. USC’s Undergraduate Student Government declined to fund a number of established student organizations this past year that had previously come to rely on university money, leaving student leaders scrambling to find last-minute donations. The cuts were in part due to the fact that more clubs applied for funding after USG leadership simplified the application process. Chuck White / Annenberg Media 3. The LA County Sheriff's Department is investigating allegations that the captain of the East LA station schemed to give valued bureau positions to Latinos in order to avoid promoting an “angry Black” sergeant. The allegation echoes concerns previously raised when Sgt. Reginald Hoffman, the officer in question, sued the county for racial discrimination that denied him promotions. Keri Blakinger / Los Angeles Times 4. Licensed cannabis retailers in California are still struggling to compete with the illicit market seven years after legalization. Recreational cannabis use is legal across the state but 56% of local municipalities still prohibit the sale of the drug, leaving people to either drive long distances in search of a legal dispensary or turn to the tax-free and more convenient illicit market. Divya Prakash and Michael Goldsmith / LAist 5. Yosemite National Park will reopen fully on Monday, park officials said, after fears of flooding temporarily shuttered parts of the park. Unseasonably warm weather that melted record snowfall in the Sierra Nevada mountains contributed to the flood fears.

An Oakland jury found former Bay Area prison warden Ray J. Garcia guilty of eight counts of sexually abusing female inmates. During his time as warden at the federal correctional institution, Garcia and four other prison staffers allegedly sexually assaulted inmates and forced them to pose naked for photos, among other crimes. Richard Winton / Los Angeles Times 3. Local wildlife officials plan to capture and evaluate Griffith Park’s famous mountain lion, P-22. The big cat is well over the typical life expectancy for a mountain lion and has recently shown signs of distress, killing a pet dog last month. Euthanasia is not a likely course of action. Liorah Goldsmith / LAist 4. The LA Police Department will retrain thousands of its officers in crowd-control tactics that it’s revised since the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests. The department’s response to the protests elicited heavy scrutiny from activists after the use of non-lethal weapons left some protestors with severe injuries. Josh Cain / Los Angeles Daily News 5.

At least six people have died in the last eight months at such events. Five council members filed a motion seeking reports and analysis for a multi-year plan and funding strategy, and the motion suggests the city could place “calming measures” such as rumble strips and raised pavement markers at intersections.

Cal ISO warned that it could issue additional flex alerts over the next week — or even initiate rolling blackouts — if electricity demand remains too high.

Princess Lang, a sophomore studying musical theater, founded the group called the Cardinal Divas of SC. ( Nia Harris / Annenberg Media ) 🌴 In L.A. Face coverings will no longer be required on L.A. County public transit as well as in train stations, airports, cooling centers, homeless shelters and correctional facilities. The changes are effective Friday. ( Christina Merino / Daily News ) Friends, brace yourselves for another heat wave starting this weekend. Luckily, though, the temperatures aren’t projected to be quite as searing as the wave earlier this month. ( Hayley Smith / Los Angeles Times ) L.A. Unified will start issuing free Narcan, an anti-overdose medication, on all of its campuses by mid-October. Narcan is designed to temporarily restore breathing in patients and allow first-responders time to arrive and begin more permanent treatment. The district’s announcement comes after a string of recent fentanyl overdoses in the school district, one of which was a 15-year-old girl who died in a Bernstein High School bathroom. ( Rob Hayes / ABC 7 ) A judge found that the sheriff’s office didn’t violate protocol in obtaining a warrant to search the home of county Supervisor Sheila Kuehl — though the judge hasn’t yet ruled on the validity of the warrant itself. Previously, critics accused Sheriff Alex Villanueva’s investigators of requesting the warrant from a judge they knew would be friendly to their cause; the judge on Thursday reported that it was a mere coincidence that the request landed on Judge Craig Richman’s desk. Richman has a decades-long relationship with one of the sheriff’s department’s lead investigators. ( Alene Tchekmedyian / Los Angeles Times ) 🌅 California A lawsuit filed by a data privacy watchdog alleges that a Northern California utility company racially profiled Asian communities when feeding power use information to authorities in an effort to root out illegal marijuana grows. Abnormally high electricity use can often be a telltale sign of illegal grow houses, though the suit asserts that the Sacramento Municipal Utility District didn’t look for high electricity use in predominately white neighborhoods, and that a police analyst removed non-Asian-sounding names from the list provided by the utility. ( Don Thompson / Associated Press ) 🚨 In case you missed it A team of undergrads launched an app called “Mist” on Monday, where users anonymously compliment others on campus and then have the option of connecting via direct message. Personally, my question is whether this will turn out to be a compliment-disguised-as-booty-call app, or a genuine form of social media.

Nothing should fundamentally change on your end except for a visual refresh that’s coming soon, and these emails might start coming from a different address. I have a sneaking suspicion that I might have to start reeling in The Rylan Report on the weekends, too. (Lol.) I’ll keep you posted on all these changes as they happen. On the backend, this shift is going to help me build a team that will make this sustainable in the long term, keep improving and get it out to a much larger audience. I would be lying if I didn’t also mention that it’s nice to get paid for this work now. The only bad part of this is that now I have to change my Slack job description from “Really good at being bossed around by upperclassmen” to “Newsletter Editor.” It’s a tough life I’ve got. Enjoy today’s edition! 📍 On campus In an October 2020 deposition, Rick Caruso repeatedly declined to answer questions about a USC investigation into former gynecologist George Tyndall while being grilled by lawyers for hundreds of USC students and alumnae, a recent Los Angeles Times review found. Now running for mayor, Caruso — who became chair of the university’s board just after revelations of Tyndall’s sex crimes became public — has long positioned his steering of the university out of crisis as an example of the leadership he would offer in City Hall. ( Benjamin Oreskes, Harriet Ryan and Matt Hamilton / Los Angeles Times ) 🌴 In L.A. The L.A. City Council unanimously elected Paul Krekorian as council president. The former Democratic state assemblymember from the San Fernando Valley succeeds the now-disgraced Nury Martinez, who resigned over a leaked recording that showed her making racist and disparaging comments. ( Alexander Nieves and Lara Korte / Politico ) Enrollment in the L.A. Unified School District shrank again this year — but not by as much as district leaders expected. The new figures suggest that rising housing costs and a declining birthrate continue to affect enrollment, but also that some COVID-related pressures may be easing. California funds public schools based on how many students attend classes, meaning the new student enrollment numbers will have a direct impact on the district’s bottom line. ( Kyle Stokes / LAist ) Some Southern California parents are calling for an increased police presence on school campuses, especially after a string of teen fentanyl overdoses in L.A. County — but students activists are pushing back. ( Howard Blume / Los Angeles Times ) L.A. County libraries will soon be stocked with the overdose-reversal drug Narcan. The county will train librarians to administer the drug, and residents will be able to pick up doses to take home. ( Paige Austin / Patch ) 🌅 California Has a right-wing movement to flip school boards landed in the California Bay Area? Nationwide, conservative donors are pouring money into school board races, hoping to capitalize on lingering COVID resentment and flaring culture wars. That movement might be starting to reach one of the most liberal parts of the country. ( Joshua Sharpe and Sophia Bollag ) A California jury convicted Paul Flores of the murder of Kristin Smart. The verdict capped a long-running case that began in May 1996 when Smart, a freshman at Cal Poly, left an off-campus party around 2 a.m. accompanied by Flores. Smart was never seen again.

Share this with a friend 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The Natural History Museum across the street from USC is throwing a block party this Sunday. The free event will feature music, food trucks, and dance performances to celebrate the museum’s new two-story community center that’s complete with a cafe and 75-foot-long dinosaur. Matthew Royer / Annenberg Media 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The video is wild. At first glance, it looks like a brown bear broke into a parked Rolls Royce in a Southern California suburb then proceeded to tear up the inside of the car. Turns out it was actually just a dude in a bear costume, prosecutors said as they unveiled the nutty insurance fraud scheme. Clara Harter / Los Angeles Times 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] LA could become a “sanctuary city” for undocumented immigrants. City officials say they’re drafting ordinance that would prohibit the use of LA’s resources to assist federal immigration enforcement in the event of a Trump-induced deportation spree — though it’s unclear when the city council will vote on it. Marissa Wenzke / KCAL News 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Big wins in California swing districts handed Republicans the U.S. House majority, cementing the party’s control of Congress. The state’s notoriously slow vote counting process delayed official results in the tight competition, though it had been fairly clear since Election Day that the GOP would take the lower chamber. Guy Marzorati / KQED 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] John Krasinski was named PEOPLE’s “ Sexiest Man Alive ,” and the USC community isn’t pleased. “His peak was, like, 10 years ago,” one alum said. A few students said they’d instead vote for Mike Faist , Regé-Jean Page , or Dev Patel — but two made sure to say their boyfriends deserved the title.

It’s Tuesday, and I can’t stop watching Mark Zuckerberg try to dap up a UFC champion ahead of a fight in Anaheim over the weekend. Sorry Zuck. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Developers broke ground on a 1,284-bed luxury apartment near USC that’s expected to open in August 2026. The Standard at Los Angeles will feature a resort-style rooftop pool, outdoor grilling stations, Jumbotron, study lounges, mini market, a “clubroom” and 24-hour fitness center. The new property sits a few blocks south of campus and will host 429 units in addition to five renovated townhomes. Pro tip: Don’t sign a lease before the place actually opens . Kristin Harlow / REBusiness Online 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Yet another storm is dousing California, though it hasn’t caused as much damage as the one earlier this month — thus far. Many of the mountains surrounding LA were under a flash flood warning Monday as Southern California bore the brunt of the storm, and Ventura and Santa Barbara counties saw as much as 10 inches of rain. Further north, thunderstorms with a chance of hail swept through the Central Valley while forecasters warned of strong gusts and a weak tornado landing south of San Francisco. Expect more rain today. Staff / The New York Times 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Police are searching for four protestors who allegedly committed hate crimes against members of the Turkish consulate when they spoke at USC in September. The suspects allegedly pushed, punched, kicked and threw water at the officials as they left a panel discussion in Wallis Annenberg Hall. The event had spurred a heated protest and clashes with police when students turned out to criticize the university’s decision to host members of the Turkish state — which denies the Armenian genocide — while Azerbaijan launched an offensive against the majority-Armenian state of Nagorno-Karabakh. Christina Chkarboul / Daily Trojan 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Something sells faster than fentanyl in San Francisco’s open-air drug markets: sugar. Every night, vendors flood the streets with sacks — and sometimes wheelbarrows — full of candy and sodas. They sell out in minutes. Studies have shown a strong correlation between opioid use and sugar consumption, possibly because the two activate similar pleasure centers in the brain. “Some of this shit might get you higher than dope,” said a dude selling Kit Kats named Jay Dog, who also claimed to be a Marin County crip. David Sjostedt / The San Francisco Standard 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] In 1875, a crew of explorers climbed a 5,968-foot peak on the south end of the San Gabriel Mountain range, hoping to survey the tallest mountain in the region. The going was rough: There were no trails, so they had to bushwack their way up the thorny chaparral with heavy equipment in tow. Imagine their dismay when they reached the summit, looked east, and spotted a taller peak just a half-mile away. Oops! The forlorn surveyors named the peak “Mount Disappointment,” and the name has stuck ever since.

FYI: If you’re a California resident, you can now sign up for a digital driver’s license . There are a limited number of free signups available, so do it soon if you’re interested. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Some California regions may have to cut their water use by as much as 20% by 2025 under a new state framework for urban water supply. Water utilities in the Central Valley and southeastern region will likely face the harshest cuts, while LA won’t face any reductions until 2030. The novel framework weighs local factors like climate and population in setting reductions, as opposed to previous policies that applied uniform cuts across the state. Staff / Los Angeles Times 2. California’s COVID wave is reaching levels not seen in more than a year, thanks to new highly contagious strains of the virus. The state’s test positivity rate — the most reliable tracking metric now that state and federal agencies have stopped logging case counts — sits at 14%, the highest since July 2022 and in fact the fifth highest since the pandemic began. Harriet Blair Rowan / The Mercury News 3. LA tenants have received over 40,000 eviction notices since late January — a return to pre-pandemic levels as renter protections expire — most of which were issued by upscale apartments in places like downtown and Woodland Hills. The notices serve as a legal obligation for tenants to pay their rent and are a precursor to eviction lawsuits, though they rarely escalate to that point. The revelation was made public by the city controller’s office, which for the first time shared details about the notices. Staff / Los Angeles Times 4. Higher-income Californians will no longer qualify for electric vehicle rebates once a popular state program in place since 2010 runs out of money this year. Instead, the state will shift its focus to lower-income Californians, offering subsidies as large as $12,000 for people who earn less than 300% of the federal poverty level — which is currently $43,740 for a single person. Alejandro Lazo / CalMatters 5. A California judge temporarily halted a Chino Valley Unified School District policy that would’ve forced school staff to inform parents if their children changed their gender identity or pronouns. State Attorney General Rob Bonta, whose office is suing the district over the policy, previously said he was also looking to stop other conservative school districts from enacting similar policies.

If you’re staying in Los Angeles over the break, check out Annenberg Media’s guide to some things you might consider doing. This will be the last newsletter until a 10-article weekly roundup next Friday. And now, onto the five USC, LA and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Gov. Gavin Newsom asked President Biden to issue an emergency declaration in more than 20 California counties — LA and San Bernardino included — as the state braces for another weekend of rain while still recovering from the last blizzard. Federal aid could provide generators, road-clearing equipment and medical supplies that many Southern California towns are in need of. Hanna Lykke / Los Angeles Daily News 2. Former LA Mayor Eric Garcetti may finally get the ambassadorship to India he’s long pined for. The U.S. Senate could vote on his nomination as soon as next week, potentially closing a process that’s taken almost two years after it was stalled by questions over whether Garcetti should have known a city hall aide was allegedly sexually harassing colleagues during his time as mayor. Jennifer Haberkorn / Los Angeles Times 3. USC will launch a $10 million initiative to fund generative artificial intelligence research. The Center for Generative AI and Society will pull faculty from Annenberg, Rossier, Iovine and Young, SCA and Viterbi in a multi-disciplinary effort to prepare students for professional landscapes where generative AI is — or soon will be — at play. “Our students are going to use this technology, and we need to teach them how to use it responsibly,” one USC official said. Sarah Ju / Daily Trojan 4. Walgreens pushed back against its $54 million California contract cancelation, arguing that Gov. Newsom is unfairly targeting the pharmacy chain for planning not to dispense abortion pills in states where Republican attorneys general threatened legal action. CVS and Rite Aid both said they plan to dispense the pills where legally permissible, but didn’t say whether they’d cease distribution in the same states as Walgreens. John Woolfolk / The Mercury News 5. No prominent Republican has announced plans to run for Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s seat in 2024, perhaps another reminder of the waning Republican power at the California state level — despite recent successes in the House. A GOP candidate hasn’t won a statewide office since 2006, and the state hasn’t elected a Republican senator since 1988. Seema Mehta / Los Angeles Times You’re all caught up.

Tomo Chien February 27, 2024 p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Good morning. It’s Tuesday, and I’m reading about how Fremont was named the happiest city in America. I’m a little skeptical. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] If you have a minute to spare, please fill out this quick feedback form that’ll give us valuable data to show donors in a major fundraising event next month. Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Gov. Gavin Newsom is facing yet another recall attempt from the same conservative group that tried to oust him three years ago, which this time around is pointing to the state’s budget deficit and the governor’s role as a surrogate for Joe Biden. Turns out it could just be a grift. Rescue California, the group that initiated the effort, owes more than $1 million mostly to staff from the last recall campaign. This second effort will allow the group to raise more money to pay back those debts, but it’ll also likely enable the group’s vendors and organizers to pocket millions like they did last time — only to fail spectacularly in a special election that cost taxpayers some $200 million. The grift worked once… so why not try it again? Josh Koehn / The San Francisco Standard 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Southern California Edison will pay $80 million to cover damages from the Thomas Fire that killed two people and destroyed more than 1,000 buildings in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties in 2017. The fire, which torched over 280,000 acres, started when winds caused two power lines to slap together. Its damage later triggered a mudflow that killed 23 in Montecito. The utility didn’t admit wrongdoing or fault in the settlement with the federal government, even though state investigators previously found that the utility neglected regulations that could’ve prevented the fire. Brittny Mejia / Los Angeles Times 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A year ago, Rep. Adam Schiff called for advertisers to boycott Fox News, decrying the network’s “shameful” leadership and hosts that propagated misinformation that threatened to undermine American elections. But he’s since changed his tune. Schiff has spent millions on Fox advertising slots to air attack ads against Republican Steve Garvey as he campaigns for California’s open U.S. Senate seat — a strategy that seems to be working. The Burbank congressman, of course, isn’t the only Democrat in the race who’s advertising on Fox, but he is the only one to renege on a promise to boycott the network. Christopher Cadelago / Politico 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Student workers in the California State University system voted to unionize in a landslide election last week, meaning essentially any student employed by the university — including undergrads — is now a union-eligible worker. It’s now one of the largest student unions in the country with over 20,000 student assistants systemwide. Students say they hope that the union can fight for higher pay, more hours and sick leave. “This is for all of us and for all of our futures,” one student assistant said. Ashley A. Smith / EdSource 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A California neo-Nazi who goes by “Scottie BigBalls” is raising money on a Christian crowdfunding site to tour city council meetings and espouse antisemitic rhetoric. His name is actually Harley Ray Petero Jr., and he comes from a long and venerated tradition of neo-Nazis who hijack council meetings with hate speech in an attempt to provoke First Amendment lawsuits. COVID was the golden era for these people: Cities shifted their meetings to Zoom and allowed for virtual public comments, which meant that anybody could call for the “nationwide expulsion” of Jews from the comfort of their own home. But most cities have ended virtual participation — in most cases because of neo-Nazi trolls — thus Scottie’s fundraising push.

Here are the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. California legislators are considering exacting penalties on the oil industry, a move which Gov. Gavin Newsom has pushed for citing what he calls price gouging and supersized profits. Notably, the governor characterized the proposal as a penalty rather than a tax — which means the eventual bill would need fewer votes to pass. Christine Mai-Duc and Benoît Morenne / The Wall Street Journal 2. Los Angeles teachers are calling for higher wages, smaller classes and a reduction in standardized testing. The unionized educators in the country’s second-largest school district staged three separate rallies on Monday. Howard Blume / Los Angeles Times 3. Tens of thousands of Angelenos could face eviction in the new year when pandemic-era tenant protections expire. The end to rental assistance programs and eviction moratoria could spell disaster for many of the county’s low income residents and exacerbate an already dire housing crisis. Danielle Kaye / NPR 4. The University of California strike is still going strong. Protestors are in fact amping up their tactics, staging sit-ins to disrupt university officials in their offices and accusing the university of negotiating in bad faith. Tim Johns / ABC7 5. Southern California regulators called on the federal government to help curtail the region’s air pollution in order to comply with a 2015 federal standard for ozone. Ports, rail yards and airports — big polluters in the nation’s smoggiest region — all fall under federal jurisdiction. Tony Briscoe / Los Angeles Times You’re all caught up.

I’m stoked to start Morning, Trojan again under our new nonprofit news outlet, College Brief . p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Before we start: I’m reading about how Disneyland is offering discounted tickets to Southern California residents. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] When Johnny Cash performed at San Quentin State Prison in 1969, the inmates loved his hit “San Quentin” — a song about how that same prison was a “living hell” — so much that they made him play it twice. 50 years later, Gov. Gavin Newsom wants to change the status quo. An advisory board suggested turning San Quentin into a “model rehabilitative center” by offering more vocational training, removing double-person cells and training guards to befriend inmates. The proposal is based on prison policy in Norway, a country that saw a steep drop in repeat offenses after focusing prisons on rehabilitation. Nigel Duara / CalMatters 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Researchers discovered a massive dumping ground for military weaponry off the coast of LA. The UC San Diego oceanographers found, among other things, World War II-era Hedgehog and Mark 9 depth charges typically dropped from warships to destroy submarines. The U.S. Navy said the waste is likely a result of disposal practices typical of the time and that it’s working to determine “the best path forward to ensure that the risk to human health and the environment is managed appropriately.” Rosanna Xia / Los Angeles Times 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The states that rely on the Colorado River are racing to reach a new water use agreement ahead of Inauguration Day, worrying that a possible change in the White House could delay talks. The parched river has long been a lifeline in the West, providing drinking water to some 40 million people and irrigating much of America’s farmland. But its long-declining flow has led to years of bitter negotiations among its dependents, including California. The federal agency in charge of the river set a March deadline for states to propose a new agreement. Christopher Flavelle / The New York Times 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A federal appeals court blocked a California law that bans concealed firearms in most public places, the latest drama in a saga that’s seen the controversial law get blocked, then unblocked and now blocked again. The law bans people from carrying concealed guns — regardless of whether they have a concealed carry permit — in 26 types of public places including playgrounds, churches, banks and zoos. Staff / Associated Press 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] When a monster swell pounded the California coast late last month, most (sane) people moved further inland. Not the surfers. Half Moon Bay’s famous Mavericks Beach became something of a mecca for elite big-wave riders, offering set after set of estimated 50-foot waves. One videographer just released a free film documenting the action. “It literally feels like you’re going to be splashed from your TV,” one Mavericks pioneer said of the film.

Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The Trump administration is quietly restoring some National Institutes of Health grants it previously revoked from universities. But there appears to be no pattern to which grants officials are reinstating, leaving researchers baffled. “Nobody at our institution is sure of what happened, or if this is permanent,” said a University of Colorado professor. Stephanie M. Lee / The Chronicle of Higher Education 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A USC sophomore developed a software script that’s already helping pediatric cancer patients at Children’s Hospital LA. Arjun Karnwal, a biomedical engineering student, created a program that helps clinicians more effectively map tumors for radiation treatment. Before, the process took two hours. Now it takes eight minutes. Greta Harrison / USC Viterbi 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC’s student government named May “Jewish American Heritage Month” in a unanimous vote last night.

Two firefighters — including one who had to be intubated and airlifted to a burn unit — were injured critically. The truck driver called 911 after noticing something was wrong with the tractor and managed to escape unscathed. Officials said no homes were in danger because the explosion was in an industrial area.

Sophie Sullivan / Annenberg Media 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] California’s ethnic studies debate was already contentious, but it’s gotten even worse with the Israel-Hamas war. The timeline is clear: All the state’s public high schools must offer the subject — ​​broadly described as the study of non-white people in the U.S. — by 2025, and it’ll be a graduation requirement by 2030. But the thorny question is what the course will actually teach. A model curriculum that state educators drew up has come under fire for including lessons about Jewish Americans but not discussing the Israel-Palestine conflict. So of course, critics are counterproposing curriculum that excludes Jewish history and criticizes Israel. Expect this one to keep heating up. Dana Goldstein / The New York Times 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Police arrested an Ontario-area high school senior who allegedly planned to shoot up his campus in an homage to the Columbine High School massacre. Sebastian Villasenor, 18, was booked Wednesday in San Bernardino County. Police recovered 1,000 rounds of ammunition, seven rifles, two revolvers, a handgun and a shotgun from the Villasenor family home, and thanked the high schooler’s parents for their cooperation. Officials said they discovered the plot after a student who became aware of Villasenor’s plans alerted school administrators. Andrew J. Campa / Los Angeles Times 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] OpenAI unveiled a new program that can turn text prompts into minute-long videos. The tool, called Sora, comes from the same San Francisco-based company that created ChatGPT and DALL-E. It’s not open to the public just yet: Select creators and security experts are testing the program for safety vulnerabilities. But sample videos show the program is capable of advanced concepts like stitching together shot changes from different camera angles without being told in the prompt — while also looking quite good.

Some good news: If you’re a California resident, you most likely now have until October to file your tax return. That extension was granted in 44 of the state’s 58 counties in response to this year’s severe winter storms. And now, onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. More than half of California is no longer in a drought, federal officials reported, after the Sierra snowpack reached its highest point in 30 years and the entire state was soaked twice over since January. LA County is still classified as “abnormally dry” — one level below drought — and experts warned that the deluges have done little to recharge the Colorado River, a major source of LA water. Paul Rogers and Scooty Nickerson / The Mercury News 2. In a scathing report, a special counsel appointed by LA’s Sheriff Civilian Oversight Committee called the department’s deputy gangs a “cancer” that “must be excised.” The report found that deputies “valorize violence” by throwing parties when deputies shoot civilians and have in many cases wrested control of patrol stations from their respective officers through intimidation. Frank Stoltze / LAist 3. Sen. Dianne Feinstein was hospitalized Thursday in San Francisco with shingles. The 89-year-old senator was diagnosed with the virus late last month and is expected to make a full recovery, a spokesperson said. The virus, which generally causes a painful rash, is rarely life-threatening. Shira Stein / San Francisco Chronicle 4. The LA County Board of Supervisors could soon impose a mandatory earthquake retrofit for buildings with the same type of flawed concrete that caused catastrophic damage in the earthquakes in Turkey and Syria. The board asked county officials to prepare rules that would require “non-ductile” buildings to be retrofitted within 10 years, and to create an inventory of “soft story” buildings prone to collapse in an earthquake. Rebecca Ellis and Rong-Gong Lin II / Los Angeles Times 5. Federal regulators took the unusual step of granting the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant — which produces 9% of California’s electricity — an exemption that would allow it to keep running after its operating license expires. It was the latest development in a long-running drama over the fate of the plant, which Gov. Gavin Newsom has argued is essential as the state transitions to a clean power grid and environmentalists have described as a catastrophic liability. Michael R.

At current tallies, Democrats hold the Senate 48 to 47, and Republicans hold the House 197 to 174. We still won’t know the final results of some races for weeks — and the GOP could still take control of both chambers — but a widely expected decisive Republican victory did not materialize last night. The red “wave” was more of a “ripple,” as one panelist at yesterday’s Annenberg watch party quipped. Personally, I ran off with an industrial-sized bin of leftover Chipotle chips and salsa from the Annenberg Media Center, so I don’t have much to complain about. Check out photos from AM’s photo desk here , or my own here . And now, here’s the rest of the news you need to know for today. 1. Democrats predictably swept key state-level offices. Gov. Gavin Newsom, Attorney General Rob Bonta and Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis all cruised to reelection. Sen. Alex Padilla — appointed in 2020 to fill Vice President Kamala Harris’ seat when she left for the White House — became the first Latino ever elected to represent California in the U.S. Senate. Staff / CalMatters 2. The Los Angeles mayoral race is still too close to call. Businessman Rick Caruso leads with 51.25% of the vote while Rep. Karen Bass trails with 48.75%. Only 14.04% of the expected vote has been counted. Julia Wick, Benjamin Oreskes and James Rainey / Los Angeles Times 3. Former Long Beach Police Chief Robert Luna holds a sizable lead over incumbent Alex Villanueva in the L.A. County sheriff’s race. With 42% of the expected vote in, Luna holds 56.8% and Villanueva trails with 43.2%. Staff / The New York Times 4. Californians voted to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution, rejected a proposition to allow betting on sports games and upheld a ban on flavored tobacco. (Check out the Chronicle’s story for a full rundown of ballot propositions.) Dustin Gardiner / San Francisco Chronicle 5. Re: the flash-flood warning you probably got yesterday afternoon. Turns out it was only meant for about 1,500 people in the Fish Fire burn area east of Duarte, but it was mistakenly broadcast to all of L.A. County. Still, one person was killed and two went missing Tuesday morning as stormwater rushed parts of the Ontario region. Alexandra E. Petri and Christian Martinez / Los Angeles Times 6. A Black L.A. County sheriff’s sergeant sued the county, alleging he was subject to retaliation for complaining of racial discrimination and the presence of a deputy gang at the East Los Angeles Station. Sgt. Reginald Hoffman is seeking unspecified damages. City News Service 7. COVID-19 was the second-leading cause of death in the first six months of 2022 in L.A. County, behind coronary heart disease. Still, COVID’s mortality rate in the first half of 2022 was significantly less deadly than the same span in 2021. Rong-Gong Lin II, Luke Money and Emily Alpert Reyes / Los Angeles Times Nation / world There was more to the story than inflation — Democrats showed up to protect abortion and democratic rights, blocking the “red wave” Republicans had predicted across the country. ( The New York Times ) Neither Georgia Democratic incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock nor Republican challenger Herschel Walker have reached more than 50% of the vote, which could mean control of the Senate will be decided in a December runoff election. ( Reuters ) Senate control comes down to four states: Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Wisconsin. But it could be a while before those races are called because of a high number of mail-in ballots. ( Politico ) New York Governor Kathy Hochul won her first full term by a narrow margin, although Democratic losses are expected in bot†h the state legislature and Congress. ( The New York Times ) Kentucky voters rejected a proposed anti-abortion state constitutional amendment, and Michigan voters solidified abortion rights in the state constitution.

Rachel Swan / San Francisco Chronicle The Orange County Board of Eduction is facing backlash over a proposed curriculum ban. The policy, proposed by Trustee Ken Williams, would forbid teaching curriculum that advocates for abolishing the police or claims that systemic racial oppression exists in America.

It’s Monday, and we’re reading about Los Angeles’ cookie craze — and where you can score the sweet benefits . Onto the five USC, LA and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Sorry to get your hopes up. The possession of natural psychedelics like “magic mushrooms” will remain illegal in California after Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill that would have legalized the substances. The governor cited the need for more regulation before legalizing. State Sen. Scott Wiener — who sponsored the bill — said he intends to launch a new effort next year focused on the therapeutic aspects of the drug. Amancai Biraben / LAist 2. Kaiser Permanente healthcare workers returned to work Saturday after a mammoth three-day strike in five states and Washington, D.C. — which hit California facilities particularly hard. Both sides agreed to resume stalled contract negotiations this week, but union leaders warned that they’re prepared to go on strike again. The dispute has centered on workers’ demands for higher pay and what they characterized as a chronic staffing shortage in the nation’s largest private healthcare system. Steve Gorman and Ahmed Aboulenein / Reuters 3. Police are increasing patrols around Jewish institutions in LA, Beverly Hills and Santa Monica in response to the war in Israel that exploded over the weekend. A handful of local leaders, including Beverly Hills Mayor Julian Gold, outright called for the U.S. to support Israel in the conflict. LA Police Chief Michel Moore stopped short, noting that his department serves both Jewish and Muslim communities. Staff / City News Service 4. Gov. Newsom vetoed a controversial bill that would have made California the first state to ban caste-based discrimination. Newsom called the bill “unnecessary,” noting that the state already has legislation that prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, religion and ancestry. Opponents of the bill had argued that it would unfairly target Hindus and people of Indian descent. Deepa Bharath / Associated Press 5. Young Californians committed far fewer violent crimes than they had in previous decades in the lead-up to the pandemic, a new report found. The findings could have significant implications in the state, which closed its juvenile detention facilities over the summer and has made it a priority to reduce the number of people it incarcerates. The report excluded the pandemic years because researchers are still working to understand why crime spiked across the board during that period.

Good work, team. (And welcome, new subscribers.) Here’s the news you need to know for today. 1. Los Angeles County will pay $47.6 million to settle several lawsuits alleging misconduct by sheriff’s deputies. In three cases, deputies shot people; in a fourth, they failed to prevent an inmate from killing himself and in a fifth, a man suffering a mental health crisis died after being violently restrained by deputies. Alene Tchekmedyian / Los Angeles Times 2. The L.A. City Council booted protesters using bullhorns and noisemakers from its Tuesday meeting. In the past, the council has allowed the activists — who are demanding that Councilmembers Kevin de León and Gil Cedillo resign over their involvement in the city council racism scandal — to remain at council meetings. De León and Cedillo have refused to step down despite the urging of their council colleagues. Eric He / City News Service 3. Orange County declared a health emergency as its hospitals overflow from an early surge of respiratory infections, particularly respiratory syncytial virus among children. The broader United States is seeing an unusually early surge in pediatric RSV cases. Jackie Fortiér / LAist 4. The man accused of assaulting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband with a hammer pleaded not guilty to charges including attempted murder. David DePape broke into the couple’s San Francisco home with the intent of holding the house speaker hostage and torturing her. Dani Anguiano / The Guardian 5. Nearly a third of southern Sierra Nevada forests were killed in the last decade by wildfires, drought and bark beetle infestations. The Sierra covers about a quarter of California’s landmass, and the losses will have grave consequences for state wildlife. Hayley Smith / Los Angeles Times 6. A survey found a significant drop in the number of female passengers riding L.A. buses and trains. 50% of respondents cited crime, sexual harassment and safety concerns. Steve Scauzillo / Los Angeles Daily News 7. The father of an 8-year-old who made the news for ascending Yosemite’s El Capitan pushed back against critics. Veterans in the sport accused Joe Baker of intentionally misleading the media about his son’s accomplishment in order to solicit attention and donations. Sam Baker, the 8-year-old, used fixed ropes to “jug up” the rock face without actually scaling the granite; his father argued that the difference between “climb” and “rope ascent” is a matter of semantics. Gregory Thomas / San Francisco Chronicle Nation / world Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily blocked a House committee from accessing former President Donald Trump’s tax returns.

It’s Wednesday, and we’re reading a guide to the best French fries in Los Angeles . Onto the five USC, LA and California stories you need to know for today. 1. The off-duty pilot who attempted to crash a San Francisco-bound flight was having a “mental breakdown,” witnesses said. The pilot, 44-year-old Joseph Emerson, told police that he consumed psychedelic mushrooms 48 hours before the flight and has suffered from depression for a long time. Experts said it’s doubtful that Emerson would’ve still been under the influence two days after consuming the drugs, but the psychedelics could’ve further destabilized an already fragile mental condition. Michael Levenson / The New York Times 2. More than 30 states including California jointly filed a federal lawsuit against Meta, alleging apps like Instagram and Facebook are intentionally addictive and harmful to children’s mental health. The suit accuses the tech giant of violating federal and state online privacy protection laws by tricking users with “false and misleading” claims that the apps are safe for children and not meant to promote unhealthy engagement. If successful, the lawsuit could change how Meta markets its products and result in substantial fines for the corporation. Staff / Politico 3. The California DMV suspended Cruise’s license to operate driverless taxis in San Francisco after the company allegedly withheld footage of a severe crash involving one of its vehicles. The crash occurred after a human driver hit a pedestrian and hurled her into the path of a Cruise taxi. Waymo, a competitor, will still be allowed to operate, but the suspension nonetheless underscores the city’s skepticism of the technology despite increasing public adoption. Ricardo Cano / San Francisco Chronicle 4. Muslim parents in the LA Unified School District said their children felt targeted by a superintendent’s statement that strongly supported Israel and featured a Star of David and Israeli colors. Supt. Alberto Carvalho released a more broad statement condemning violence in general about a week later. Still, at Tuesday’s board meeting, many Muslim parents alleged “one-sided” class discussions and episodes of harassment. Howard Blume / Los Angeles Times 5. A hiker was rescued after being stuck in a cave east of San Diego for 16 hours over the weekend. The unidentified woman tried to pass through a 12-inch opening before getting stuck. First responders worked overnight to rescue the woman, inching their way through the cave system and slowly passing their gear along. The hiker managed to avoid any severe injuries.

Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. An off-duty pilot on a San Francisco-bound flight attempted to shut down the plane’s engines before being subdued Sunday. The crew said that 44-year-old Joseph Emerson, a Bay Area resident, tried to trigger the fire suppression system — which would’ve cut off fuel, electricity and hydraulic power to the engine — while sitting in the cockpit’s jumpseat. The pilots were able to subdue Emerson, who was jailed on suspicion of attempted murder. FBI investigators are still piecing together a motive. Dominic Gates and Renata Geraldo / The Seattle Times 2. A federal trial for the captain of the Conception — the boat that caught fire in 2019 off the California coast, killing 34 people onboard — begins Tuesday with jury selection in LA. Jerry Boylan, the captain, is accused of failing to post a night watchman who could’ve spotted the blaze earlier and potentially prevented the worst maritime disaster in recent memory. Boylan previously went on trial in 2020, but a judge tossed the indictment. He’s now charged with one count of misconduct or neglect of ship officer and faces 10 years if convicted. Boylan has pleaded not guilty. Stefanie Dazio / Associated Press 3. California officials are urging residents to prepare for a second winter of heavy flooding, evacuations and power outages, thanks to a strengthening El Niño weather pattern expected to bring wetter-than-average conditions to the state. More than 7 million California residents live in areas at risk of flooding, officials say, and state agencies are already working to distribute emergency supplies like sandbags. Jessica Garrison / Los Angeles Times 4. Officials are investigating allegations that LA County hotels are replacing striking workers with unhoused migrants living on Skid Row — then underpaying them and potentially violating child labor laws. Unite Here Local 11, the union representing the hotel workers who have been on strike since July, first brought the allegations to the LA County District Attorney. Advocates allege that the hotels have taken advantage of vulnerable migrants in an effort to undermine union workers fighting for a living wage. Suhauna Hussain / Los Angeles Times 5. Surprise! A Harvard-based study found that 1 in 3 children from the wealthiest American families tend to score a 1300 or higher on the SAT, while just 5 in 100 middle class test takers manage the same feat. The disparities begin long before students take the tests — and schools aren’t always at fault. The disparities instead may stem from the fact that American neighborhoods are increasingly becoming segregated by income, and outside-of-school factors like stress in home lives, parents’ vocabulary and what children do after school have a large impact on academic performance.

The turbines, which will float on the deep ocean along California’s coastline, could one day power 1.5 million homes. Nadia Lopez / CalMatters 2. LA County is facing another COVID surge. Cases — which are likely underreported — nearly doubled over Thanksgiving and have translated to more hospitalizations as the county already struggles to contend with RSV and the flu. Luke Money and Rong-Gong Lin II / Los Angeles Times 3. The LA City Council banned the sale and distribution of Styrofoam products, effective April 2023 for businesses with more than 26 employees and April 2024 for those with fewer. Styrofoam, which is not biodegradable or easily recyclable, has been classified as a possible carcinogen. Eric He / City News Service 4. The California snowpack is off to a good start this winter. A pair of storms dumped several feet of snow on the mountains and doused low-elevation regions with rain, but experts warn that the good news will likely mean little in the face of the state’s fourth consecutive year of drought. Diana Leonard / The Washington Post 5. The San Diego City Council green-lit a plan to transform the largely car-dependent neighborhood of Mira Mesa into a more walkable and dense urban area.

Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Typically, when a Trojan football legend dies, USC issues a signature red-lettered release with carefully crafted words of condolence. No such luck for O.J. Simpson, the infamous former USC tailback who died yesterday at age 76 from cancer. USC’s silence in Simpson’s passing underscored, perhaps for the final time, the university’s fraught relationship with its alum ever since his murder trial. By the way: Here’s the best Simpson meme I saw yesterday. Luca Evans / Los Angeles Daily News 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Pro-Palestinian protests are once again roiling California college campuses. At the elite Claremont Colleges in LA County, 20 students were arrested last week after storming and occupying a university president’s office. Students have since staged more protests. At UC Berkeley, a video of a professor trying to grab the microphone of a pro-Palestinian protester disrupting an invite-only backyard dinner went viral earlier this week. The protester claims the incident was “clear Islamophobia” and assault. Jaweed Kaleem and Caroline Petrow-Cohen / Los Angeles Times 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] California lawmakers agreed to cut $17 billion from the state’s budget — less than a quarter of what the state must ax to rectify its estimated $73 billion shortfall. The agreement slashes hundreds of millions of dollars from welfare, climate and infrastructure programs, including $300 million for a new facility at UCLA. But other parts of the plan employ sly accounting tricks: like delaying $1.6 billion in state payroll by just one day, so it technically falls in the next fiscal year. One Republican called it the “mother of all gimmicks.” Sophia Bollag / San Francisco Chronicle 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Public universities in California are required to offer students medication abortions, but their costs vary vastly across campuses. At some California State University campuses, the medication is free while supplies last. Others highly subsidize the costs of the pill and don’t charge for appointments. Meanwhile, University of California schools leave any student not on the university insurance program — including those with the low-income state-sponsored MediCal — with a bill that reaches into the hundreds of dollars. Jackie Fortiér / LAist 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Two Bay Area airports are gearing up for an all-out war.

More on that below. Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A man suspected of burglarizing a USC student’s apartment on Thursday camped overnight in an abandoned building while police waited outside. Authorities said they reached a “stalemate” with the suspect after he ran into the building and set a small fire, and decided to leave late that night so he’d be “less annoyed” and come down on his own. Onlookers apparently threw the suspect a beer and offered him pizza while he was holed up in the building. He was arrested Friday morning, and nobody was hurt. Quinten Seghers / Daily Trojan 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A UC Irvine professor thinks today’s solar eclipse could help heal the country’s partisan divisions. Paul Piff, who studies psychology and social behavior, says that awe — the feeling when you experience something so vast and mysterious that you reevaluate your worldview — can often cause people to set aside their differences and work toward the greater good. Expect LA’s partial eclipse to peak around 11 a.m. Karen Kaplan / Los Angeles Times 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Almost everybody agrees that a troubled railway between LA and San Diego needs to move further inland: The problem is actually making it happen. Over the last six years, climate change-driven storms and sea level rise have shut down the Pacific Surfliner train at least a dozen times. But any effort to move the railway inland faces two big problems. For one, homeowners are diametrically opposed to the idea of the train tunneling under their neighborhoods. And even if they agree to it, the construction is prohibitively expensive. Jim Carlton / The Wall Street Journal 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] More than a year ago, a mass shooting at a farm in Half Moon Bay rattled Northern California. Now, a migrant farmworker who survived five gunshots that day is suing the farm and one of its owners, saying they failed to protect him from the coworker who opened fire. The suspected shooter killed seven of his then-current and former coworkers across two mushroom farms last January, and prosecutors say the company knew he had a history of violence. Olga R. Rodriguez and Haven Daley / Associated Press 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A San Francisco-based startup says it can identify STIs with just a photo of a penis. Doctors are sounding the alarm. Calmara.ai , which launched last month, notes either “Clear! 🌶️ 🔥🍆 ” or “Hold!!! We spotted something sus” after its algorithm processes the user-submitted photo. Forget about the long list of privacy and ethical concerns: The app is usually just wrong. Like, so wrong that it gave the all-clear to photos of a penis-shaped vase and penis-shaped cake. “There are so many things wrong with this app that I don’t even know where to begin,” one doctor said.

Proponents of the bill — the president of Cal ISO, among them — argued that the plant’s closure would strip the state of a vital clean power source. Detractors raised concerns about nuclear waste and safety given the plant’s proximity to seismic fault lines. The bill now heads to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has stated that extending the power plant’s life is a top priority.

Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. A shooting in a Trabuco Canyon biker bar left three dead and six injured Wednesday evening. Two patients are in critical condition and four are stable. Orange County Sheriff’s deputies shot and killed the suspect — a retired Ventura police officer targeting his estranged wife, two anonymous sources told the LA Times — on the scene. Staff / Los Angeles Times 2. The USC Alumni Association tentatively settled a class-action lawsuit brought on by alumni who claim that their alumni status and ensuing privileges were revoked in an act of negligent misrepresentation and false advertising. The settlement includes a payout of $81,550 in USC Bookstore gift certificates to the suit’s 1,631 class members, averaging $50 each. Christina Chkarboul and Eva Hartman / Daily Trojan 3. The LA City Council voted Wednesday to approve a contract that would increase spending on police officer pay by $1 billion over the next four years. An officer’s starting salary would increase from $74,000 to more than $86,000 within the first year of the agreement taking effect. The move comes as Mayor Karen Bass seeks to boost raises and bonuses in an effort to better recruit and retain officers. Josie Huang / LAist 4. Uber raised the minimum age requirement for its California drivers to 25, citing rising costs of commercial auto insurance in the state. A company spokesperson said that a “cottage industry” of personal injury attorneys who specialize in suing rideshare platforms has raised the company’s California insurance cost by more than 65% in two years. The previous age requirement was 19. Staff / Associated Press 5. California firefighters are adopting an artificial intelligence program that can identify wildfires from live footage collected by a network of more than 1,000 mountaintop cameras in the state’s most fire-prone regions — a network that’s traditionally monitored by human operators.

Here are the five USC, Los Angeles, and California stories you need to know for today. Share this with a friend 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Orion Housing was ordered to pay a UCLA alum nearly $5,000 for wantonly withholding his security deposit and acting “in bad faith” in a lawsuit. Previous tenants say the student housing firm, which owns over 100 properties near USC, has a habit of ignoring infestations and maintenance issues and issuing bogus charges. Anjanae Henry / Daily Trojan 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A judge temporarily blocked Donald Trump’s Monday order to freeze all federal grants and loans, but the mandate has still led to widespread chaos in academia. The order is separate from Trump’s previous, specific pause on reviewing research grant proposals ; rather, this freezes funding that’s already been awarded across the entire federal government. Max Kozlov and Dan Garisto / Nature 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC is considering offering “early decision” undergraduate admissions for prospective business and accounting majors. The decision is not finalized, but, if approved, would be implemented in the 2026-27 admissions cycle. USC currently only offers a non-binding “early action” application window. Christina Chkarboul / Daily Trojan 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC will seek to delay federal law enforcement from entering campus in the event of an immigration raid. Existing USC policy order staffers to “politely” turn away law enforcement, and note that the university’s general counsel must first review all warrants. In the “unlikely event” feds force their way through, staffers will call DPS. Katie Simons / Annenberg Media 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Black residents in Altadena were more likely to have their homes damaged or destroyed in the Eaton fire than their neighbors, a UCLA study found.

Here are the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Residents of the flooded Monterey County town of Pajaro were allowed to return to their homes nearly two weeks after waters burst through a nearby levee. The town still has no potable water and the sewer system doesn’t work. Aid organizations have descended on the agricultural community, lending a hand to residents struggling to clean up the mess the flood left behind. John Woolfolk and Aldo Toledo / The Mercury News 2. The LA Unified School District strike ended Thursday, bringing school operations back to normal starting Friday morning. Still, the labor dispute remains unsettled: Union leaders have threatened a more prolonged strike to force the district’s hand at the bargaining table, though they’ve expressed hope that Mayor Karen Bass’ mediation will smooth the talks over. Staff / Los Angeles Times 3. A report found that LA recorded its highest ever number of antisemitic incidents in 2022. The audit, published by the Anti-Defamation League, showed that antisemitic incidents have tripled locally since 2017 and listed antisemitic banners, literature and calls to local synagogues as examples. It also specifically called out rapper Kanye West as having influenced this trend. Travis Schlepp / KTLA 4. USC shuttle workers voted to unionize and join Service Employees International Union Local 721, the largest public sector union in Southern California. The 32-person union consists of shuttle drivers and dispatchers who operate USC’s intercampus shuttle lines — and who were some of the last remaining non-unionized shuttle workers in the LA region. Tomoki Chien / Daily Trojan 5. California educators are cautiously optimistic that the state’s long-running teacher shortage could be getting better. Between academic years ending in 2017 and 2021, the state saw a 35% increase in the number of teachers who earned a preliminary credential, reversing a decade-long downward trend and making California one of the few states in the country to see an increase at all.

Here are the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Rep. Nancy Pelosi said she’ll endorse Rep. Adam Schiff for Senate — so long as 89-year-old Sen. Diane Feinstein doesn’t seek reelection. Schiff, a Burbank Democrat, rose to national prominence after serving on the House Intelligence Committee from 2008 to 2023 until getting the boot from Speaker Kevin McCarthy last month. Joe Garofoli / San Francisco Chronicle 2. Black Lives Matter activists slammed Mayor Karen Bass for supporting Chief Michel Moore’s reappointment, noting they feel “betrayed” by the city’s first Black female mayor. Moore came under fire in 2020 for his handling of protests following the killing of George Floyd, but has also at times been praised for the reform he’s brought to the police department. Linh Tat / Los Angeles Daily News 3. California’s nearly $23 billion deficit could come back to hurt college students. Experts say private institutions like USC will remain relatively insulated, but the hundreds of thousands of students in the state’s public universities could see delays in capital and housing projects. Sparsh Sharma / Daily Trojan 4. State lawmakers are gearing up for a potential showdown with the U.S. Supreme Court’s conservative supermajority as they seek to impose ever-tightening gun legislation in the wake of last month’s spate of mass shootings. A bill announced Wednesday would ban people — even those with concealed carry licenses — from carrying firearms in public spaces and privately owned businesses open to the public. Adam Beam / Associated Press 5. The fate of a prospective union of USC graduate student workers will hinge on a Feb. 15-16 election, the National Labor Relations Board confirmed in a notice Wednesday. A simple majority vote of union-eligible workers will decide the outcome. Tomoki Chien / Daily Trojan You’re all caught up. Thanks for reading Morning, Trojan, and have a good day.

Tomorrow’s the big night: Trojan football takes on UCLA in what will be a season-defining matchup. Here’s everything you need to know if you’re planning on heading to the Rose Bowl. And now, here are the seven USC, LA and California stories you need to know for today — plus five from the nation and world. 1. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will step down from Democratic leadership in the next Congress, ending a historic tenure as the caucus’s leader. Pelosi, who will remain a rank-and-file representative, said the attack on her husband in the couple’s San Francisco home played a major role in her decision to step down. Marianna Sotomayor and Paul Kane / The Washington Post 2. A 22-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after he swerved into the wrong lane and crashed into 25 Los Angeles County sheriff’s recruits on a morning training run. He was released late Thursday night because of insufficient evidence — though investigators plan to arrest him again once they’ve built a case. Alexandra E. Petri, Richard Winton and Brittny Mejia / Los Angeles Times 3. UC Berkeley’s law school won’t participate in the U.S. News rankings, mirroring announcements from Harvard and Yale a day earlier. The school’s dean said the rankings disincentivize universities from doing things “we think are critical to our profession and role in society.” Michael Cabanatuan / San Francisco Chronicle 4. A Los Angeles International Airport worker died after being exposed to carbon dioxide fumes, weeks after he was hospitalized and put in a medically induced coma. Cris Abraham, 36, was repairing a leaky pipe in an airport electrical vault when a fire suppression malfunctioned and flooded the room with carbon dioxide. Cindy Von Quednow / KTLA 5. Powerful Santa Ana winds wreaked havoc in parts of LA and Ventura counties this week, toppling semi-trucks, damaging electrical infrastructure and spreading fires. The gusts, which hit 102 mph in Santa Clarita, are expected to die down Friday then return Saturday — albeit not as strongly. Kat Schuster / Patch 6. Shipments to the ports of LA and Long Beach plummeted 26% compared to the same month last year, the lowest volume since May 2020. The port’s executive director said protracted labor negotiations are forcing importers to move their goods to the East and Gulf coasts. Paul Berger / The Wall Street Journal 7. The University of California Board of Regents punted a decision to block UCLA’s Pac-12 defection to Dec. 14. Critics of the school’s move to the Big Ten Conference have cited increased travel time and cost, along with millions in lost revenue for UC Berkeley — which would suffer from a less lucrative TV contract if its LA counterpart flees the conference. Teresa Watanabe and Ben Bolch / Los Angeles Times Nation / world By Anna Hsu CONTRIBUTOR Reps.

But now people are literally parachuting off the skyscraper. “I guarantee you tragedy will take place there if that place is not boarded up quickly,” said Mayor Karen Bass. The City Council approved a motion last week that gives the Chinese developers who abandoned the construction site until Saturday to secure the property, but city officials still haven’t been able to contact them. Alex Rozier and Helen Jeong / NBC Los Angeles 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A real estate mogul and first responders unions are pouring more than $1 million into the race to unseat progressive LA City Councilmember Nithya Raman. Attack ads funded by that money paint Raman as one and the same as George Gascón, the LA County district attorney who has sought lighter penalties for people convicted of crimes — and now faces an 11-person slate of more moderate candidates looking to oust him. But property and violent crimes have actually dropped over the last two years in Raman’s district, as have violent crimes in the county at large under Gascón’s watch. Frank Stoltze / LAist 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Officials recovered the body of a hiker who went missing on Mount Baldy earlier this month after a drone operator reported spotting a young woman on the mountain Saturday. Rescuers found 22-year-old Lifei Huang dead. Huang, who embarked on a solo hike just as an atmospheric river swept through the region, is the latest in a string of fatalities that the notorious mountain just outside LA has claimed. Mount Baldy is known to kill even serious outdoorsmen with its dangerous winter conditions and has been described as one of the deadliest peaks in the U.S. Dani Anguiano / The Guardian 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] In the second California Senate debate, Rep. Katie Porter tried to bait the frontrunner, Rep. Adam Schiff, into a fight. He had none of it. Instead, Schiff seemed more eager to pile on Republican Steve Garvey and continue his strategy of portraying the election as a two-man race between him and the only Republican in the field, who stands little chance in a general election in a deep-blue state. Schiff has pumped millions of dollars into TV ads that similarly portray Garvey as the main opponent, in what’s essentially an effort to make the other Democratic candidates look irrelevant and ensure he’ll face a more defeatable opponent come November — in California, the top two primary candidates regardless of party qualify for the general election. Melanie Mason and Christopher Cadelago / Politico 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] California’s reputation has taken a hit. Half of U.S. adults believe the state is on the decline, and half of Republicans even believe that it’s “not really American,” according to a new nationwide survey. Thoughts on the Golden State largely fell along party lines, but 3 in 10 Democrats notably said that California is too liberal. Some of the results were also just ridiculous: 3 in 10 Republicans said the state has a worse natural environment than other states — forget about the nine national parks and Pacific coastline — so take it all with a grain of salt.

Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Planned Parenthood bought a large facility near USC, but it’s not clear what it’ll use the property for. Marketing materials note that about a third of the 73,600-square-foot industrial facility is office space, and the reproductive healthcare provider said only that its LA branch “is expanding its footprint and our headquarters as we prepare for the future.” The $37.9 million property sits a few blocks from campus, just east of the 110 Highway. Greg Cornfield / Commercial Observer 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC President Carol Folt blamed financial aid, higher wages, mental health programs and the school’s free Lyft service for this year’s $3,294 tuition hike. And when asked why the university walked back its controversial decision to cut a scholarship called the Academic Achievement Award, Folt said in the same interview that she “sat down and took a breath” before recognizing that the award was “one of the more important programs.” I could think of a few things that might’ve helped prompt that deep breath. Staff / Annenberg Media 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A woman gave birth on the sidewalk just two blocks south of USC late Monday night, apparently after her water unexpectedly broke. Firefighters arrived on the scene to help the woman deliver her baby and cut the umbilical cord, and footage showed them later handing the newborn to its mother swaddled in a towel. Officials said the mother and child were taken to the hospital but didn’t know their status. The woman hasn’t been publicly identified. Andrew J.

Shanahan previously founded a firm that helped patent owners manage their intellectual property, and was formerly married to Google co-founder Sergey Brin. The 38-year-old political newcomer is expected to boost the ticket’s appeal among young voters, with the added advantage of a large personal fortune: Shanahan has already contributed more than $4.5 million to Kennedy’s effort. Rebecca Davis O’Brien / The New York Times 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] In 1992, a journalist went undercover in a San Francisco high school. Shann Nix — a 26-year-old reporter known for her gonzo, undercover stories — was looking to chronicle the effects of steep budget cuts in the city’s school district. So she devised a backstory, donned a costume and went undercover at George Washington High School for a full month. Indeed, she exposed just how dire the situation was in the budget-strapped classrooms. But students were pissed when she revealed the ruse. “That’s fair,” Nix said. “I would feel the same way.” Peter Hartlaub / San Francisco Chronicle"},{"slug":"plummeting-test-scores-a-tight-mayoral-race-the-weinstein-trial-and-more","title":"Plummeting test scores, a tight mayoral race, the Weinstein trial and more.","date":1666712324000,"web_exclusive":false,"content":"*|MC_PREVIEW_TEXT|* View this email in your browser Good morning.

Granted, I think most of you work for Annenberg Media, so this is sort of like when your mom says you did a really good job as one of 30 background monkeys in your kindergarten class’s rendition of “The Jungle Book” — but it’s exciting nonetheless. And now, here are the USC, L.A. and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Student test scores plummeted across California during the pandemic, undoing nearly a decade of academic progress. The state education department’s report coincided with a federal report showing similar declines nationwide. Joe Hong and Erica Yee / CalMatters 2. Rick Caruso has closed the gap on Rep. Karen Bass in the Los Angeles mayoral race , gaining ground on what was previously a double-digit deficit in the polls. The likely culprit? Ad money — and lots of it. Alexander Nieves / Politico 3. Harvey Weinstein’s second sex crimes trial is underway in L.A. The former movie mogul is already serving a 23-year sentence after a New York conviction, but he’s appealing that trial; if he’s successful there, a guilty verdict in L.A. could be the only reason he stays behind bars. Jaclyn Diaz and Rachel Treisman / NPR 4. Millions of Californians are struggling to pay their water bills. Drought restrictions are a partial culprit: When water use drops, urban water utilities — which mostly have fixed costs — earn less revenue, so they raise costs for customers. But in the long term, factors like the replacement of aging infrastructure and new treatment standards are driving up prices too. Dorany Pineda / Los Angeles Times 5. The suspected Stockton serial killer used an untraceable ghost gun in his killing spree. Ghost guns, which are sold in disassembled kits, don’t have serial numbers and can be bought in parts online without a background check. Wesley Brownlee, 43, has been connected to six slayings in the Central California city. Nora Mishanec / San Francisco Chronicle 6. Thousands of new apartments could soon come to Santa Monica despite objections from city officials. That’s because of a provision in state law that kicks in when cities fail to produce a housing plan to accommodate projected population growth. According to experts, developers are most likely to use the tactic in wealthy areas with high potential profits. Liam Dillon / Los Angeles Times 7. Southern California hospitals are seeing a surge in RSV cases earlier than usual. RSV — short for respiratory syncytial virus — tends to more severely affect young children and older adults. Linh Tat / Los Angeles Daily News Other things I’m reading If you only read one thing today: “ The Way Los Angeles Is Trying to Solve Homelessness Is ‘Absolutely Insane’” ( The New York Times ).

Other: “Want Power? Stop Saying ‘Sorry’ So Much” ( The Wall Street Journal ). “We’ve Been Thinking About Holograms All Wrong” ( New York ). I thought the story on L.A. homelessness — a column from Ezra Klein — did a particularly good job of explaining all the things that make it so difficult to build affordable housing in this city.

The comedy bit seems to be fairly popular, so I figured I’d give it its own archive. In case you missed it Police reported a spate of antisemitism in L.A. over the weekend, with Beverly Hills authorities investigating a handful of flyers blaming gun control on Jewish people a day after a group draped antisemitic signs over a highway overpass. The latter group directly referred to recent antisemitic remarks from Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West. Stuart A. Thompson / The New York Times Gov. Gavin Newsom and Republican challenger Sen. Brian Dahle sparred in the only scheduled gubernatorial debate over homelessness, abortion, gas prices and climate change. Notably, Dahle attacked Newsom for what many have seen as jockeying for a potential 2024 run at the White House; when asked, Newsom committed to serving all four years of his term as governor if reelected.

Share this with a friend 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Police quelled a large pro-Palestinian protest that roiled USC yesterday, arresting 93 demonstrators as they cleared an encampment in Alumni Park. The testy, all-day confrontation saw its share of flare-ups between police and largely peaceful students. Officers at one point fired a rubber bullet into a crowd of protesters and apparently struck at least one. But by around 9 p.m., an army of LAPD officers in riot gear had cleared the demonstration off campus, and the Alumni Park encampment was over before it could even reach the 24-hour mark. Staff / Los Angeles Times 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] At Cal Poly Humboldt, pro-Palestinian demonstrators are entering their fourth day of occupying one of the school’s administrative buildings. Police arrested at least three as hundreds of demonstrators gathered around the building in support of a group of students who barricaded themselves inside. University leaders said they plan to keep campus closed through the weekend, and indicated that they’re prepared to shutter it for even longer . Sage Alexander / Times-Standard 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] State officials filed criminal charges against a top advisor to LA County District Attorney George Gascón, accusing the advisor of improperly downloading records with the confidential information of sheriff’s deputies she was investigating. The charges sent shock waves through the state legal community, and could significantly affect how Gascón executes his mission of law enforcement accountability. The advisor’s attorney denied the charges and said his client was working “within the scope of her employment.” Staff / Los Angeles Times 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] In a staggering reversal, a New York court overturned former Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein’s 2020 rape conviction, citing “egregious” improper rulings — like when the trial’s judge allowed women to testify about allegations unrelated to the case. The reversal will reopen painful testimony in the criminal trial that set off the #MeToo movement and a national reckoning over sexual assault and harassment. Weinstein will remain in prison because of a separate conviction in LA. Michael R.

Police threw flash-bangs as they tore down tents, and demonstrators responded in kind by spraying fire extinguishers at them. The heavy-handed police presence was in contrast to yesterday, when police took hours to intervene when a mob of counterprotesters threw bricks and fireworks into the encampment — then targeted and beat four student journalists. Staff / Los Angeles Times 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC President Carol Folt said in an Academic Senate Meeting yesterday that she regrets not being more present when unrest first broke out on campus — and also not talking directly to protesters sooner. “I don’t know why I didn’t,” she said. That makes two of us. Separately: Chaos reigned yesterday when USC locked down campus in an attempt to block outside protesters from entering — but barred even students from walking in. That lockdown was separate from the new, TSA-esque entry procedures the university enacted. Staff / Annenberg Media 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A controversial plan to build a city from scratch in a rural swath of the Bay Area got one step closer to reality: Developers gathered enough signatures to field a ballot measure that could overturn restrictive zoning laws preventing the city’s construction. The billionaire-backed project, dubbed “California Forever,” promises to build an affordable, walkable city that could help solve the state’s housing crisis. But residents have questioned whether it’ll force them out of their communities — and some say they were tricked into signing the petition.

Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] California police are dodging transparency laws to avoid handing potentially embarrassing documents to the public. Key pieces of state legislation were supposed to open certain records related to police misconduct — including shootings, unlawful searches, discrimination and sexual assault — to anybody who requests them. But in practice, police often simply deny records requests and hope the requester won’t take them to court; keep cases marked as “pending” so they can’t be touched; and destroy documents as soon as they’re legally permitted. Tyler Dedrick / Associated Press 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC’s law school named its first Black dean: Franita Tolson, who’s filled the post in an interim capacity since last summer. She’ll formally assume the permanent mantle next week. Tolson, who’s only the second woman ever to hold the law school’s deanship, is a national leader in election law.

Chinyere Cindy Amobi / USC Today 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A jury found LA’s former deputy mayor guilty of orchestrating a pay-to-play corruption scheme. Prosecutors said that Raymond Chan, whose case covered the period between 2013 to 2018, helped a former City Council member shake down Chinese developers for illicit bribes in order to approve their projects. In one particular scheme, prosecutors said Chan arranged for a developer to send the councilmember $600,000 to secretly settle a sexual harassment lawsuit against him — then the councilmember later approved one of the developer’s major projects. David Zahniser and Dakota Smith / Los Angeles Times 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] California is trying to Trump-proof its climate policies. The former president — who could very well serve a second term — made a habit out of attacking California’s environmental regulations during his first four years. So Gov.

That is, mind you, nearly twice USC’s tuition, which is the most expensive in the state. The cost of imprisoning people in California has risen by more than 90% in the past decade, propelled by ballooning employee compensation deals and court-mandated healthcare improvements. Experts say the state must close at least one prison a year to offset scheduled employee raises. Kristen Hwang and Nigel Duara / CalMatters 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The LA Times laid off 115 journalists, or one in every five people in its newsroom. The layoffs, which gutted the most influential newspaper in the West, have sparked renewed interest in a California bill that would require tech companies like Google and Meta to give newspapers a larger share of their advertising revenue.

Several thousand pro-Palestine demonstrators gathered in West LA near the Israeli Consulate Saturday, protesting the country’s aerial bombardment of Gaza.

Staff / Los Angeles Times 2. It was bad enough when students who signed leases at the new Hub LA Figueroa apartments had to stay in downtown hotels because construction delays postponed the building’s promised August move-in date. But then last week — in the middle of midterm season — those students were given a three-day notice to vacate the hotels and move into another temporary accommodation at The Lorenzo apartments. Angelina Hicks / Annenberg Media 3. Low-income Mexican residents who live within 45 miles of the California border will soon be eligible for in-state community college tuition under a new law signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom.

Nina Fathizadeh, 41, and Shahin Gheblehshenas, 64, face felony counts of child endangerment and criminal negligence. Authorities say the toddlers were able to make their way into the pool because the safety fence’s gate was left propped open and Fathizadeh allowed the children to play out of her line of sight. Ramon Antonio Vargas / The Guardian 5. Six California cities — LA, Long Beach and Glendale included — will install automated traffic cameras in “high accident corridors” to ticket drivers after Gov. Newsom approved a pilot of the enforcement system. Drivers who are caught at least 11 mph above the speed limit will be fined $50, with increased penalties for motorists at extremely high speeds.

Indeed, a loophole in housing regulations has for years allowed developers to rapidly convert single-family homes into student-minded housing, effectively pushing out predominantly Black and Latino residents near the University Park Campus. “This campus has grown tremendously and it’s at the expense of the people who used to live here,” one protester said.

It’s the latest case in which a California district attorney has employed the once-novel strategy of charging drug dealers with murder, as officials search for answers to the state’s fentanyl epidemic. Last August, a Riverside jury found a drug dealer guilty of second-degree murder in what was then hailed as a landmark case in California. It’s unclear if this is the first time that LA has used such a strategy. Terri Vermeulen Keith / City News Service 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] California regulators moved to punish farmers who have for years drained groundwater supplies with little to no oversight. State officials said farmers in the Tulare Lake subbasin, one of the state’s largest agricultural regions, must pay a first-of-its-kind fee on the groundwater they pump: a punishment for extracting so much water over the last decade that the ground sank by 6 feet in some areas and household wells which everyday people rely on are at risk of running dry. Jake Bittle / Grist 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] San Francisco is coming down hard on pro-Palestinian protesters who blocked the Golden Gate Bridge earlier this week. The city’s district attorney said she plans to charge the 26 people arrested by police with false imprisonment, an unusually harsh charge that could force them to pay restitution to commuters who were trapped on the bridge during the hourslong demonstration. Legal experts say the charge is based on shaky grounds, and activists called the move a “criminalization of dissent.” Jonah Owen Lamb / The San Francisco Standard 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Griffith Park has long been notoriously dangerous for cyclists, who must dodge rush-hour commuters speeding through the park with no official bike lanes. Two years ago, a cyclist was struck and killed by a drunk driver, and in another gruesome incident, a cyclist was dragged under a car for nearly a quarter mile. But that could soon change. City officials approved some $4 million in safety improvements throughout the park, which include reducing the number of lanes for cars and dedicating them to bikes and pedestrians. “This will bring the roads back to their purpose, which is to bring people to the park,” one cyclist said.

The encampment does not yet feature tents, but students say they plan to stay in the park on tarps and blankets until USC acquiesces to a broad range of demands which include: ending “war profiteering & investment in genocide,” ending “displacement from South Central to Palestine” and implementing a “complete academic boycott of Israel.” Staff / Daily Trojan"},{"slug":"protests-regulation-hell","title":"USC protests subject to regulation hell","date":1729782374000,"web_exclusive":false,"content":".bh__byline_wrapper .bh__byline_social_wrapper .bh__byline_social_wrapper > * + * @media (min-width: 768px) .bh__byline_social_wrapper } USC protests subject to regulation hell Tomo Chien October 24, 2024 p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Good morning.

Los Angeles Unified School District officials admitted that the scope of a 2022 data leak stemming from a ransomware attack was far broader than initially acknowledged. Thousands of current and former student driver’s license and Social Security numbers — not to mention sensitive psychological evaluations, 60 of which belong to current students — made it to the dark web. Clara Harter / Los Angeles Daily News 2. Officials urged Southern Californians to avoid driving through mountain regions, anticipating gusts exceeding 60 mph and whiteout conditions in as much as 2 feet of snow. This week’s blizzard warning in parts of LA is the first such warning on record since the National Weather Service launched its archives in 1983. Rachel Swan / Los Angeles Daily News 3. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s polarizing penalty on excessive oil company profits is still languishing in the Legislature months after the governor first proposed the bill. The oil industry, which pours tens of millions of lobbying dollars into the Legislature every year — and provides jobs in many parts of the state — remains a potent political force in the Democratic-controlled chambers. Adam Beam / Associated Press 4. Early polling showed Reps. Katie Porter and Adam Schiff in a close race to succeed Sen. Diane Feinstein. Respondents 65 and older tended to favor Schiff, while the under-40 crowd leaned toward Porter. Reps. Barbara Lee and the potentially running Ro Khanna both trailed by significant margins, though nearly half the respondents said they hadn’t made up their minds. Benjamin Oreskes / Los Angeles Times 5. Newsom and billionaire Elon Musk appeared to rekindle their bromance in a jovial press conference Wednesday, when Tesla announced it’ll open its new engineering headquarters in Palo Alto — an appearance meant to promote California’s commitment to electric vehicles.

Seven stories for today, Sept. 30 📍 On campus Disaffiliated fraternities are now considered regular, private student housing, meaning the university can no longer oversee or regulate their activities and rush processes. That’s long been known to be true, but that fact and others were laid out in an updated university FAQ page about disaffiliated fraternities earlier this month. ( Nina Moothedath, Lorenzo Arce and Melisa Cabello Cuahutle / Annenberg Media ) 🌴 In L.A. The southern section of the California Interscholastic Federation voted to make girls flag football an official fall sport, paving the way for the broader state federation to do the same in February. The federation will do a first read on the proposal next week. ( Tarek Fattal / Daily News ) A Cypress woman was charged with killing a man by ramming her car into him after accusing him of trying to run over a cat. ( Associated Press ) The third and final suspect in the slaying of rapper PnB Rock at a South L.A. restaurant was arrested in Nevada. Freddie Lee Trone, 40, was located and arrested in Las Vegas, and is pending extradition to Los Angeles. ( City News Service ) The L.A. County Board of Supervisors proposed permanently adopting several pandemic-era rental assistance programs, like allowing tenants to avoid being evicted if they fall behind on about a month’s rent. ( Nathan Solis / Los Angeles Times ) Authorities arrested a man dubbed the “Blue Cloth Bandit,” suspected in a string of over five dozen robberies over the span of nearly two years. Charles Chukwuma Onwuemelie, 29, earned his nickname for his alleged habit of using a cloth to cover a handgun during robberies. ( City News Service ) 🌅 California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed two bills to incentivize converting underutilized and vacant commercial buildings into housing, in an effort to ease a statewide housing crisis. Both bills guarantee union-scale wages and promise an expedited construction process, while keeping development close to city centers to help the state meet its environmental goals and avoid sprawl.

Yesterday’s story in the Daily Trojan — the one about the school of social work no longer using the term “field work” — got so many views that the website crashed. That’s a new one. And now, here are the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Rep. Barbara Lee said she’s running for the Senate in a closed-door meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus. The Oakland Democrat didn’t say whether she’d still run if 89-year-old Sen. Dianne Feinstein seeks reelection, but Lee’s decision no doubt kickstarts the coming tussle between her, Rep. Katie Porter and Rep. Adam Schiff — who’s widely expected to run for the seat. Nicholas Wu / Politico 2. Try not to jump in creeks, rivers, the ocean and even puddles near storm drains for the next couple of days. LA County health officials released an advisory effective until at least Friday afternoon, warning of bacteria, chemicals, debris and trash swept up by this week’s rain that could contaminate storm water around the city. Jackie Fortiér / LAist 3. Thanks to the rounds of recent storm systems, California’s snowpack currently holds more than twice the water it would at this time in a normal year: a boon for the state’s parched reservoirs once the snowpack melts in the warmer months. Mike Ives / The New York Times 4. The death toll after the seventh atmospheric river storm to lash California since Christmas rose to at least 19. Officials, including more than 100 members of the National Guard, were still searching for a 5-year-old boy swept away by floodwaters in San Luis Obispo County. Staff / Los Angeles Times 5. Gov. Gavin Newsom is taking heat for proposing cuts to climate spending in his latest budget proposal. Newsom, facing a $22.5 billion deficit, suggested slashing $6 billion from a $54 billion multi-year climate spending package — a move that activists say will disproportionally affect low-income communities.

Here are the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Many Southern California garment workers who assemble clothes for leading fashion brands are victims of egregious wage theft and illegal pay practices, a U.S. Department of Labor investigation found. In one instance, workers earned as little as $1.58 an hour — essentially no better than a Chinese sweatshop. Many garment workers are immigrants who are too scared to complain to authorities. Scott Schwebke / Orange County Register 2. USC has no plans to revert its free Lyft program to a single-rider model, and will only offer the unpopular shared rides in the foreseeable future. Students previously bemoaned long wait times and safety concerns when the university scrapped the pandemic-era policy of single-person rides in favor of the original shared service. Staff / Annenberg Media 3. The University of California will guarantee systemwide admission for qualified transfer student applicants in a policy that is the first of its kind. To receive the guarantee, community college students must earn a minimum GPA in general education and UC major-specific coursework. Acceptance to specific campuses isn’t guaranteed, except for at UC Santa Cruz, UC Merced and UC Riverside. Teresa Watanabe / Los Angeles Times 4. California, New York and Massachusetts are among states whose pro-labor forces are pushing for a minimum wage increase to $20 an hour. Rising inflation means that the $15 per hour wage workers achieved a few years ago can no longer adequately cover living expenses. Opponents of the increase say it will negatively impact small businesses still recovering from the pandemic. Maysoon Khan / Associated Press 5. Economists told California’s reparations panel that it could cost more than $800 billion to compensate Black residents for decades of over-policing, disproportionate incarceration and housing discrimination. The state’s annual budget is $300 billion, though reparations are far from a guarantee: The panel needs to flesh out its recommendation by July 1 and the proposal ultimately must survive the Legislature.

Marilyn Flynn, a former USC dean who allegedly conspired with Ridley-Thomas, previously pleaded guilty as well. Frank Stoltze / LAist 2. Gov. Gavin Newsom will mount a renewed attack against Republican stronghold states by putting $10 million toward a new political action committee. The governor — increasingly involved in national politics — has sought to juxtapose California’s progressive agenda with that of states who are limiting abortion rights and expanding gun laws. Jeremy B. White / Politico 3. A proposed California bill would establish an “Ebony Alert” system to inform locals of missing Black children and young women ages 12 to 25 — similar to the “Amber Alert.” The senator who proposed the bill cited the underreporting and overrepresentation of missing Black children and young women in California. Noah Goldberg / Los Angeles Times 4. California’s reparations task force said it won’t suggest how much money the state ought to compensate Black residents, instead leaving that number up to the Legislature. Economists earlier this week estimated that it would cost $800 billion to properly compensate for decades of over-policing, disproportionate incarceration and housing discrimination. Janie Har / Associated Press 5. Got hay fever? You’re probably going to be miserable this spring. The winter’s heavy rain is likely to give way to a high pollen count as trees, weeds and grasses blossom across California’s green landscape. Try keeping windows shut or conducting any outdoor exercise routines before dawn or in the evening to avoid the midday pollen peak. Louis Sahagún / Los Angeles Times You’re all caught up.

One said he would vote if only “there was, like, a link I could just click on and then send it in.” A business major said he feels like “other people will take care of that.” And a media studies student, who isn’t voting, chided people for failing to focus on local elections.

A scuffle broke out at the LA Times Festival of Books after protestors rushed the stage where archaeologist Richard Hansen spoke about his work in El Mirador Basin in Guatemala, the site of ancient Mayan towns. Protestors accused Hansen of being a “Gringo colonizer” for his controversial effort to increase archeological tourism in the area. Hansen has maintained that his proposals are environmentally sustainable and have won the support of Maya leaders. Reed Johnson and Laura Newberry / Los Angeles Times 2. It turns out this winter’s snowpack wasn’t quite as historic as officials made it out to be: The year with the highest levels of snow since the state started formally collecting data was actually 1983. Among a number of faulty calculations that led to the overstatement was the fact that the state shifted the definition of a “normal” snowpack to keep on pace with climate change, which inflated more recent percentages. Scooty Nickerson / The Mercury News 3. One man was left dead after a shooting in Exposition Park near USC on Sunday night. Police said three suspects approached the victim, described only as a Black man in his 30s, while he was sitting in the passenger side of a vehicle. An argument broke out and shots were fired. The victim was taken to the hospital where he succumbed to his injuries. No arrests have been made. Josh DuBose / KTLA 4. The “Big Melt” is on: California’s heavy winter snowpack is melting as temperatures warm, breathing new life into the state’s long-parched creeks and rivers. But the dangerously swift and cold waters pose a threat to anyone hoping to swim or raft, and many counties have issued blanket bans on public river access until further notice — to the chagrin of the rafting companies. Gregory Thomas / San Francisco Chronicle 5. California Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis launched her bid for the 2026 gubernatorial election, putting herself well ahead of what’s expected to be a competitive field. In her current role — often considered a stepping-stone post that offers little in the way of built-in responsibilities — Kounalakis has fought against UC and CSU tuition hikes and helped deliver three major offshore wind projects.

Police Department concluded that an officer’s death in a May training exercise was an accident that occurred when he and another officer fell to the ground while grappling during a simulation.

Here are the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Prosecutors charged seven California Highway Patrol officers and a nurse with manslaughter for their roles in the 2020 death of a man in custody who shouted “I can’t breathe!” as the officers forcibly drew blood to measure his alcohol level. Video footage showed that none of the defendants acted with urgency even after the man, Edward Bronstein, went limp and lost his pulse. Richard Winton and James Queally / Los Angeles Times 2. California may end a ban on state-funded travel to any state with laws it deems are anti-LGBTQ. The prohibition was initially in retaliation to a 2016 North Carolina ban on transgender people using public bathrooms according to their gender identity. Following a surge of LGBTQ-discriminatory legislation in many Republican states, that ban now applies to nearly half the country. Adam Beam / Associated Press 3. The Lucas Museum of Narrative Art is set to open in 2025 across the street from USC. (It’s the building that looks vaguely like a spaceship on Exposition Boulevard.) The museum, which is the work of the filmmaker and USC alumnus George Lucas, will host some 100,000 paintings and book and magazine illustrations; it won’t be a Star Wars shrine, to the chagrin of nerds around the world. Soumya Karlamangla / The New York Times 4. Californians can now take advantage of a new program that helps first-time homebuyers finance down payments in an increasingly competitive market. To qualify for the program, which is run by the California Housing Finance Agency, individuals must not have owned a home for the past three years and remain under their county-specific income limit. Iman Palm / KTLA 5. Scientists found that an unusually severe parasite killed four sea otters off the California coast. The parasite, which hasn’t previously been seen on the California coast, is cause for concern: It could pose a public health risk if it works its way up the food chain and eventually onto dinner tables, where it could infect humans.

That would most likely mean keeping Starbucks open all night, a return to the pre-pandemic norm. ( Brianna Tang / Daily Trojan ) 🌴 In L.A. Kevin de León was clear: He’s not resigning. In two Wednesday TV interviews, the embattled L.A. city councilmember — heard in the infamous leaked recording that ended in former Councilmember Nury Martinez’s resignation — said he won’t step down despite protests from his council colleagues. ( City News Service ) A group of Black real estate developers behind a proposed downtown luxury skyscraper said that they refuse to continue working with de León for fear that he holds racial bias against them in light of the leaked recording. The proposed project is in de León’s district. A spokesman for the city councilmember dismissed the developers’ messaging as a negotiation tactic, but the developers argued that de León has been “slow-walking” them and requested that another councilmember oversee the project. ( Roger Vincent / Los Angeles Times ) For three decades, L.A. has had the most overcrowded housing among large counties in the United States. In the pandemic, low-income residents paid the deadly price for it. Here’s how it all happened. ( Staff report / Los Angeles Times ) Authorities seized about 12,000 suspected fentanyl pills found packaged in bags of candy at LAX on Wednesday. The person who tried to go through security with the pills escaped before law enforcement arrived. ( Cindy Von Quednow / KTLA ) 🌅 California University of California students are urging the school system to make jobs available to students regardless of their immigration status. It’s a push that’s coming as new enrollment in the DACA program has been shut off by federal judges, and as the student advocates say a study by immigration scholars refutes the university’s contention that offering jobs to the undocumented would violate federal immigration law. ( Bob Egelko / San Francisco Chronicle ) Domestic and international criminals stole some $20 billion in California unemployment money during the height of the pandemic. Now, the state’s trying to claw some of it back. ( Eric Westervelt / NPR ) 📖 Other things I’m reading Wednesday was a bit of a slow news day, so I got the chance to catch up on some magazine reading… What’s wrong with the CIA ? Meet the luxury buses trying to disrupt air travel. Can robots evolve into machines of loving grace? Everyone wants to be a hot, anxious girl on Twitter. How to start liking the most annoying person in your life. And, finally, power causes brain damage — though I’m a bit skeptical of that one. I also started listening to this podcast from LAist about Alex Villanueva’s controversial tenure as L.A. County sheriff. It has some production and sound engineering shortcomings, but rock solid journalism; I’ve completely lost all my confidence in the sheriff’s department. What a corrupt city. 🚨 In case you missed it The L.A. City Council unanimously elected Paul Krekorian as council president. The former Democratic state assemblymember from the San Fernando Valley succeeds the now-disgraced Nury Martinez, who resigned over a leaked recording that showed her making racist and disparaging comments. ( Alexander Nieves and Lara Korte / Politico ) Has a right-wing movement to flip school boards landed in the California Bay Area? Nationwide, conservative donors are pouring money into school board races, hoping to capitalize on lingering COVID resentment and flaring culture wars. That movement might be starting to reach one of the most liberal parts of the country. ( Joshua Sharpe and Sophia Bollag ) Forward this email to a friend who might enjoy!

It’s Thursday, and I’m reading about a rooftop cinema club in downtown . Onto the five USC, Los Angeles, and California stories you need to know for today. Share this with a friend 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The annual Sexploration Tent returned to McCarthy Quad yesterday, doling out free vibrators, handcuffs, condoms, and lube to students apparently too impatient to wait for a clandestine Amazon order. Annenberg Media astutely observed that the tent was “bigger and longer than the rest.” David Sosa / Annenberg Media 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A Santa Monica College staffer who was shot by a coworker Monday died of her wounds in the hospital. Felicia Hudson, 54, was a custodial operations manager originally from Newman, Georgia. Police have not identified a motive but believe it was a case of workplace violence. Vivian Chow / KTLA 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] It’s Trumpy on Trumpy in the Coachella Valley, where Vem Miller — the man arrested for possessing guns near the former president’s rally — just sued the Riverside County sheriff for allegedly defaming him by falsely saying he planned to kill Trump. The sheriff wanted to be “heroic,” Miller said, probably because he’s a MAGA devotee himself. Paul Albani-Burgio / Desert Sun 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The Archdiocese of LA will pay a record $880 million to over 1,300 people who say they were sexually abused by Catholic clergy as children. The settlement bookends more than two decades of litigation against the archdiocese, and, combined with past settlements, brings the total payout to over $1.5 billion. Richard Winton and Hannah Fry / Los Angeles Times 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Disneyland unveiled a new premium pass that lets guests skip lines at any time of the day — but it’ll run you $400. And that’s on top of your park ticket. The new “ Lightning Lane Premier Pass ,” though, lets you hop on rides without first scheduling a time on an app like the current fast pass requires.

Seven stories for today, Oct. 7 📍 On campus Guess which major L.A. university was a hot topic in Thursday’s mayoral debate. (Hint: It wasn’t UCLA.) Rep. Karen Bass and Rick Caruso both found themselves on the defensive in the hours-long debate, as moderators pushed Bass on her $95,000 scholarship to the school of social work, and Caruso for backtracking on a pledge to release an internal report about an investigation of a USC gynecologist accused of sexual misconduct. ( Julia Wick, James Rainey, Dakota Smith and David Zahniser / Los Angeles Times ) Duffl, a student-run delivery service, co-opted the popular high school “senior assassin” tradition in a new marketing initiative dubbed “Duffl Assassins.” The over 300 participants are given a “target” player every Sunday night and have one week to squirt that player with a water gun. The last person standing gets $300 in Duffl Cash, free delivery for a year, AirPods and a $75 901 Bar &amp; Grill gift card. ( Lexi Klein and Christian Fulton / Annenberg Media ) 🌴 In L.A. The updated bivalent COVID-19 booster has been available for a month — but just 5% of eligible Angelenos have gotten the shot. That’s about 355,000 people. The CDC recommends that everyone 12 and older get an updated booster as long as it’s been two months since their last shot. ( Jackie Fortiér / LAist ) An L.A. teen drowned near Thousand Steps Beach Wednesday evening. The Orange County Sheriff's Department identified the victim as 16-year-old Juliet Jung. ( Ashley Ludwig / Patch ) An L.A. County Sheriff's Department commander sued the county and Sheriff Alex Villanueva, alleging whistleblower retaliation. The commander said that Villanueva directed a cover-up of a video of a deputy with his knee on the head of a man in custody for three minutes, and retaliated against department whistleblowers. ( City News Service ) 🌅 California California’s homeless population grew by 22,000 over the pandemic, increasing at roughly the same pace as previous years. The crisis has disproportionately affected Latinos. ( Manuela Tobias / CalMatters ) Biden’s announcement that he’ll pardon everyone convicted under federal law for possession of marijuana — and reconsider its classification under federal law — drew praise from California Democrats: But some want him to go further and advocate for full federal decriminalization of the drug now. ( Bob Egelko / San Francisco Chronicle ) ⭐️ A bonus listicle Looking for things to do with your parents this family weekend? Check out Annenberg Media’s quick listicle. ( Sissy Arenas, Taryn Snyder and Logan Drone / Annenberg Media ) 🚨 In case you missed it Scammers are finagling money out of students for football tickets they never receive. It’s not uncommon for students who buy season tickets to resell seats for cheaper than the individual game price — but the fraudsters are causing would-be buyers to lose faith in the secondhand market. ( Salome Nebiyu, Shane Dimapanat and Carson Dorais / Annenberg Media ) Authorities have connected an additional murder of an Oakland man to a possible Stockton serial killer, as well as one non-fatal shooting of a Stockton woman. The killer has now been connected to six slayings. ( Staff report / The Guardian ) Forward this email to a friend who might enjoy! Click here to subscribe.

Some moron on my floor lit a hand sanitizing station on fire at 6 in the morning, which set off the fire alarm right around the time I wake up to write these newsletters. I’m a little miffed, to say the least. And now, onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. LA County Sheriff Robert Luna appointed a former federal prosecutor to eradicate his department’s infamous deputy gangs — groups of deputies accused of promoting violence and abusing their power on the streets and in prisons. Luna’s move was a sharp departure from his predecessor, Alex Villanueva, who denied the existence of the gangs throughout his tenure. Keri Blakinger / Los Angeles Times 2. Voting began Wednesday to decide the fate of a prospective union of USC graduate student workers. A National Labor Relations Board official said that, barring unforeseen circumstances, the board will count the votes on Friday and should have a rough idea of the result that day. Tomoki Chien / Daily Trojan 3. A legislative report warned that the University of California and California State University systems will require billions of dollars over the next decade to repair, maintain and renovate facilities — billions of dollars that aren’t readily available, and certainly not on top of an already multi-billion dollar maintenance backlog. Ashley A. Smith / EdSource 4. Rep. Barbara Lee formally filed to run for Senate a day after Sen. Diane Feinstein announced her retirement, signaling the start of the high-profile battle between her and Democratic heavyweights Reps. Adam Schiff and Katie Porter. Lee, an Oakland Democrat, had previously privately confided to the Congressional Black Caucus that she’d run for Feinstein’s seat. Alexi McCammond and Eugene Scott / Axios 5. USC Undergraduate Student Government presidential candidates will square off in a debate tonight at 7 p.m. in Wallis Annenberg Hall. Five candidates are running for the job — far more than any election in recent memory — which should give the 10 undergraduates who actually vote (the candidates and their running mates, probably) a fairly diverse range of platforms to choose from.

Seven stories for today, Sept. 15 📍 On campus USC transfer students, who often miss out on social events designed specifically for freshmen, have reported struggling with loneliness and a lack of community. (Staff report / Annenberg Media) 🌴 In L.A. The Sheriff’s Department searched County Supervisor Sheila Kuehl’s home on Wednesday morning, acting on a warrant tied to a probe of a nonprofit that one of Kuehl’s close friends runs. The search reignited claims that Sheriff Alex Villanueva — whom Kuehl has fiercely criticized in the past — is using a secretive public corruption unit to target his political enemies. (Alene Tchekmedyian / Los Angeles Times) A 15-year-old died in what police believe to be a fentanyl overdose at Bernstein High School in Hollywood. She and three other juveniles consumed what they thought were Percocet pills, which investigators believe they bought at Lexington Park less than a mile away from campus. (Jaysha Patel and Carlos Granda / ABC 7) The county board of supervisors directed its attorneys to draft a series of gun control ordinances which include a ban on the sale of .50-caliber handguns and the creation of “buffer zones” between gun shops and schools, daycare centers and parks. If passed, the laws would only apply to unincorporated county areas. (City News Service) Law enforcement officials arrested 141 people across Southern California in a weeklong operation targeting online child sex abuse. (Libor Jany / Los Angeles Times) 🌅 California California sued Amazon on Wednesday, alleging that the company illegally penalizes merchants for offering products at lower prices on competing sites. (Christine Mai-Duc and Dana Mattioli / Wall Street Journal) Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill that requires social media companies to publicly post their policies regarding hate speech, disinformation, harassment and extremism, and report data on their enforcement of those policies. The bill is expected to draw heavy backlash from the tech industry. (Olafimihan Oshin / The Hill) Forward this email to a friend who might enjoy!

Here are the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. An environmental advocacy group is pushing Gov. Gavin Newsom to limit the cultivation of crops like almonds and alfalfa, which require large amounts of water to grow. The group, Food and Water Watch, contended that large agribusinesses are some of the state’s biggest water users and should thus shoulder big sacrifices. Dorany Pineda and Hayley Smith / Los Angeles Times 2. California offered the federal government its own plan to pare back Colorado River water use, a counteroffer that came a day after the six other states who rely on the dying river submitted a joint plan that California refused to sign. Kathleen Ronayne / Associated Press 3. LA Police Chief Michel Moore will serve a second term after easily landing a reappointment from a unanimous police commission vote. Moore, who was appointed to the job in 2018 by then-Mayor Eric Garcetti, previously said he’ll only serve part of the five-year term. Josh Cain / Los Angeles Daily News 4. The Sierra Nevada snowpack is at its highest level since 1995, bringing hope to a drought-stricken state — but also raising fears of spring flooding when the snow melts. The snowpack provides nearly one-third of California’s water supply. Paul Rogers and Scooty Nickerson / The Mercury News 5. 530,000 acres of public land in California are inaccessible to the public. It’s part of a broader national phenomenon where state- and federal-owned land is surrounded on all sides by privately owned acreage, making public access impossible in practice.

Tomo Chien February 26, 2024 p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Good morning. It’s Monday, and I’m looking at stunning photos of Yosemite’s “Firefall.” Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] If you have a minute to spare, please fill out this quick feedback form that’ll give us valuable data to show donors in a major fundraising event next month. Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A potentially landmark hearing resumes today, where federal labor officials will determine whether some USC athletes should be paid employees of the university, the Pac-12 and NCAA. A ruling in favor of employee status could turn the tide on the NCAA’s long-standing insistence that its players are amateur “student-athletes” — but don’t get too excited yet. It’ll likely take a Supreme Court ruling for professional status to become the norm across the NCAA, and that’ll take years. Tomoki Chien / College Brief 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] When a UC Berkeley freshman died of a likely fentanyl overdose earlier this month, he joined nearly 200 Americans who are killed every day by the drug. It might be time to rethink the public health system’s approach to the epidemic. The CDC recommends two primary measures: using test strips and stocking the overdose reversal drug Narcan. But there are glaring problems with that approach. Fentanyl isn’t always evenly distributed in a single pill, so there’s no guarantee that the portion you test contains the substance. And Narcan works well, but only if you have a friend to help administer it — and 30% of fatal overdose victims die alone. Preaching abstinence, as boring as it sounds, might be the only way to keep kids alive. James Fishback / The Free Press 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] On a late night last November, two USC students were walking home from class when they stumbled upon a fellow student calling for help, blood gushing out of his femoral artery. Graduate students Sandeep Kahlon and Sheba Naderzad sprung into action and fashioned a makeshift tourniquet on the student’s leg using a jacket — a decision that ultimately saved his life. He had impaled himself jumping the fence outside of his apartment when the gate’s keypad broke. USC officials honored Kahlon and Naderzad with the “Lifesaving Recognition Award” last week in a small ceremony, presenting each a bronze statue of Tommy Trojan engraved with their names. Qais Adawiya and Cherry Wu / Daily Trojan 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Adjunct professors in USC’s cinema school voted to unionize Friday, adding to the ranks of a growing coalition of unionized workers at the university. The professors will join the United Auto Workers union, which also represents USC’s graduate student workers who unionized last year. Broadly, the professors are calling for higher pay and multi-year contracts, and an end to what they allege is unpaid work while preparing courses and attending trainings. USC appeared to indicate in a statement that it won’t file any objections to the vote. Katie Kilkenny / The Hollywood Reporter 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Young people aren’t voting in LA County. Only 4% of voters have submitted absentee ballots in the March 5 primary, and just 9% of those ballots represent voters ages 18 to 24. That group makes up about a fourth of the electorate. Why should you care? Well, when you don’t vote, you let your parents and grandparents run the show: Usually that means elevating older, whiter and more “establishment” candidates. And if you’re a Democrat, you might be miffed to hear that a disproportionate number of Republicans are turning out to vote thus far. See a voter guide from our partner newsroom, CalMatters, here .

It’s Tuesday, and I’m ogling these California homes . Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Developers want to change Skid Row. For decades, the neighborhood in downtown LA — that’s become more or less synonymous with the nation’s homelessness crisis — has been dominated by dilapidated hotels converted into housing for homeless residents. But now, developers want to build modern homeless housing high rises that could dramatically change the feel of the neighborhood. And one even wants to build a property for higher-income residents: But conspicuously left out the “Skid Row” descriptor in marketing materials. Liam Dillon / Los Angeles Times 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC women’s basketball couldn’t stave off the UConn Huskies in the NCAA quarterfinals, ending a historic season with a 80-73 loss. It wasn’t without triumph: JuJu Watkins, the team’s freshman star, passed the NCAA’s all-time freshman scoring record in the second quarter. And last night’s game was the first “Elite Eight” appearance for the Trojans since 1994, fresh off the team’s first Pac-12 title in a decade. Expect them to be back next year. Thuc Nhi Nguyen / Los Angeles Times 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] New video shows that San Bernardino deputies shot a kidnapped teenager to death as she surrendered and followed their instructions. The shooting occurred in September 2022, when 45-year-old Anthony Graziano allegedly shot his wife then kidnapped his 15-year-old daughter, Savannah. Deputies tracked the Grazianos and intervened on a freeway near Hesperia, but video shows that as one deputy instructed Savannah to walk toward the police line, others opened fire on her. There had previously been questions about whether Savannah was killed by her father or the deputies. Brian Rokos / The Press-Enterprise 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A California lawmaker wants to give employees the “right to disconnect” and ignore texts, calls and emails after work hours. The legislation is modeled after similar laws in France and Australia, but would be the first such protection in the U.S. if passed. The law raises some questions, though. For one, it provides an exception for after-hours contact during emergencies — but it’s hard to define what an emergency is. And for some industries, late-night emails are just part of the job. John Woolfolk and Julia Prodis Sulek / The Mercury News 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] California community colleges have given out more than $6.5 million in financial aid to scammers since fall 2021. Administrators say that fraudsters often deploy bots to enroll in online classes, collect their aid, then vanish. But sometimes they don’t leave, and actually start submitting assignments with the help of artificial intelligence — leaving professors in a Blade Runner-esque scenario. The phenomenon isn’t new, and it’s hard to tell whether it’s actually getting worse: The increase in reported fraud is likely because schools are getting better at detecting it.

Drought conditions, strong storms and man-made infrastructure that blocks sand’s natural flow to the coast have all contributed to the erosion. Lethargic federal funding and a disorganized local response aren’t helping either. Laylan Connelly and Tony Saavedra / Orange County Register 2. The LA City Council unanimously approved Mayor Karen Bass’ emergency declaration on homelessness in a tumultuous meeting. What should’ve been a simple vote devolved into chaos when embattled Councilmember Kevin de León walked into City Hall, prompting angry outbursts from activists in the room and walkouts from fellow council members. Julia Wick, David Zahniser, Dakota Smith and Benjamin Oreskes / Los Angeles Times 3. PG&amp;E Corp., the company that provides electricity and gas to much of Northern California, is struggling to find the money to fund a $50 billion plan to reduce the risk of its power lines sparking fires. The utility company is hamstrung by tens of billions in liability costs after its lines sparked a string of major wildfires in recent years. Katherine Blunt / The Wall Street Journal 4. Two adults died at UC Irvine in what appears to have been a murder-suicide. The individuals, who were related but not married, were not current students at the university, although the man had been enrolled there in 2019. Police say there is no ongoing threat to the community. Hanna Lykke / Orange County Register 5.

Burgers start as low as $7.50 and offer the novelty of Korean-inspired toppings. The restaurant, which is located in the old Stout Burgers & Beers location, plans to expand its hours to include breakfast service. Matthew Kang / Eater 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Dakota Driemeyer, a student senator known for his bombastic anti-woke antics, resigned from his role and now plans to run for a Republican committee in Illinois. He originally filed to run for a state assembly seat. The only donation on record is a $200 contribution from his parents. Tomo Chien / Morning, Trojan 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC has laid off at least 290 employees in its ongoing workforce reduction. The layoffs — which have trickled in week-by-week since July as the university seeks to close a structural deficit — most recently reached Viterbi, Rossier, and the School of Cinematic Arts. Tomo Chien / Morning, Trojan 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Students are automatically enrolled in several optional fees, including a new $292 textbook bundle that, for many, may cost more than buying books individually.

Share this with a friend 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Pissed off parents and alumni are circulating a 200-signature petition protesting the Song Girls’ name change to the Song Leaders. The guys seem to be most pissed. John from Laguana Niguel called the change a “shameful abuse,” and Steven from San Diego bemoaned the desecration of a “sacred and important” tradition. Staff / Annenberg Media 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Authorities uncovered no evidence that a man arrested for carrying guns outside Donald Trump’s weekend rally in Coachella planned to assassinate the former president — contrary to what cops initially insisted. “In observance of my 1st Amendment rights, I carry firearms in my truck,” the constitutionally confused suspect said. Staff / Los Angeles Times 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A Santa Monica College staffer shot a coworker then died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound a day later after a standoff with police, authorities said. The wounded coworker is hospitalized in critical condition. Vivian Chow / KTLA 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC women’s soccer will play Ohio State at BMO Stadium tomorrow night — a rare chance to watch the team play in one of the “coolest stadiums in the country.” It’ll also be one of the only chances to watch the No. 9-ranked Trojans play near campus this season given the ongoing construction of Rawlinson Stadium. Makena Arteaga / Annenberg Media 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A food blog ranked In-N-Out’s fries nearly dead last in its annual list of American fast food French fries. The cultish California mainstay that touts nonsense freshness to cover for its cardboard aftertaste — sue me — managed to beat out only Arby’s Crinkle Fries. McDonald’s, of course, won.

Here are the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Southern California has a paramedic shortage — so bad that in some cases, ambulances arrive on the scene with no paramedic on board. Experts, scrambling to remedy retention woes, blamed the pandemic for forcing frontline workers into close quarters with COVID patients and holding up the training pipeline. Jeff Horseman / The Press-Enterprise 2. The LA Police Department arrested one of four suspects responsible for a San Fernando Valley shooting on Saturday afternoon that left one dead and three wounded. Police said the shooting stemmed from a dispute over an alleged gang-related drug deal in the parking lot of a Trader Joe’s. Louis Sahagún / Los Angeles Times 3. A San Jose police union leader allegedly took part in an international smuggling ring that distributed synthetic opioids. Authorities said that 64-year-old Joanne Segovia — who served as the executive director of one of California’s largest police unions — had at least 61 packages containing drugs labeled as everyday items shipped to her home over the last seven years. María Luisa Paúl / The Washington Post 4. The Biden administration OK’d a California plan to require half of all heavy vehicles like garbage trucks and tractor-trailers sold in the state to be fully electric by 2035. The state, whose regulations have historically forced changes in the automotive industry because of the sheer size of its population, needed Biden’s approval because the restrictions are far tougher than federal requirements. Coral Davenport / The New York Times 5. A lost lake is reemerging in California’s Central Valley. Tulare Lake, once said to be the largest freshwater body west of the Mississippi, was drained at the turn of the 20th century when its inflows were diverted for agricultural use. But this winter’s record rainfall is causing the lake to reemerge, spelling disaster for agricultural communities built on what once would’ve been the bottom of the lake.

It’s Monday, and I’m reading about the best places to eat alone in Los Angeles. Onto the five USC, LA, and California stories you need to know for today. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The newsletter will be off tomorrow while I tend to a family emergency. Share this with a friend 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] An artist set off a ring of 10,000 “organic, sustainable” fireworks and 1,000 pyrotechnic drones above the Coliseum last night. The chichi art installation’s website mentions something about a “ heavenly secret ” and “visual story full of mystery and wonder” — but students mostly complained about the fireworks’ smoke and unpleasant smell. Nathan Elias and Syra Patel / Daily Trojan 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC dropped a lawsuit against several insurance companies who provided the school “abuse and molestation” coverage — then withheld millions when it came time to pay women abused by disgraced gynecologist George Tyndall . The insurers, on several technicalities, had refused to cough up after USC settled for over $1 billion . Staff / Law360 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A lucky break in weather conditions gave firefighters a brief window to make headway against Southern California’s three major blazes. The Line, Bridge, and Airport fires have collectively injured over a dozen people and destroyed 215 structures — though officials warned that thousands more are at risk. Paige St. John / Los Angeles Times 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Donald Trump said he would , if reelected, withhold federal wildfire aid from California unless Gov. Gavin Newsom agrees to divert more water to farmers. Prior to yesterday’s assassination attempt , Trump also somewhat fantastically claimed that “Newscum” could simply make the land “damp” to prevent the fires. Soumya Karlamangla / The New York Times 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Into sports betting? Bad news: A USC study found that average credit scores have dropped by 1% in states where online sports betting is legal — and, mind you, that drop is wholly thanks to a small subset of the population.

I’ve included 10 stories in today’s newsletter rather than the usual seven, just to make up for some of the news I missed over the fall break. See you around! 📍 On campus Monday marks the start of USC’s inaugural “Sex Week.” Check out this quick guide to the… festivities. ( Staff report / Annenberg Media ) Still need your bivalent booster or flu shot? Consider stopping by “Vaxchella” at the Engemann Student Health Center. The walk-in vaccination clinic runs 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. weekdays through Oct. 21 on the first floor. Students must be enrolled in the USC Health Insurance Plan to qualify. ( Sam Bitman, MJ Newsom and Steven Tran / Annenberg Media ) 🌴 In L.A. L.A. City Councilmember Nury Martinez resigned from her post Wednesday, succumbing to mounting pressure from constituents and influential politicians to step down after a leaked audio recording showed her making racist remarks in a private meeting with two other council members and a labor leader. ( Christine Mai-Duc / The Wall Street Journal ) Much of the outrage following the leaked council recording has centered around the council members’ racist remarks — but the bigger questions are now about the redistricting process. Here’s why. ( Jon Healey / Los Angeles Times ) A former L.A. County Sheriff's Department psychologist is suing the department and county, alleging that she suffered backlash — which included coworkers leaving dead animals in her parking space and home driveway — for complaining about gender discrimination. ( City News Service ) A report found that low-income residents in L.A. County often pay more for the same or worse internet service than their neighbors in higher-income areas. Spectrum, specifically called out in the report, disputed the findings as “intentionally misleading,” and said the report focused on short-term promotional discounts that change regularly. ( Samantha Masunaga / Los Angeles Times ) 🌅 California Authorities arrested a man they believe is the Stockton serial killer on Saturday, intercepting 43-year-old Wesley Brownlee at 2 a.m. when he may have been “out hunting” for another victim. ( Nora Mishanec / San Francisco Chronicle ) California drivers can now get digital license plates under a new law. The screens display a plate number and allow motorists to renew their registration automatically and make aesthetic modifications. ( Joe Hernandez / NPR ) State health officials have repeatedly failed to regulate health conditions in indoor gun ranges. Each time a gun fires a lead bullet, fragments and dust of the neurotoxin become airborne. That hazardous material can be safely disposed of with proper ventilation and cleaning, but officials have routinely failed to regulate ranges and follow through on violations, leading hundreds of gun range employees to contract lead poisoning over the last two decades. Thousands of customers have visited ranges with airborne lead levels that far exceed federal standards, though no public agency tracks lead poisoning cases among those customers. ( Joe Rubin / San Francisco Chronicle ) The California Coastal Commission green-lit a $140 million desalination plant in Orange County, indicating that state regulators see a place for seawater desalination plants in the California’s effort to bolster water supplies. ( Rachel Becker / CalMatters ) 🏆 The Sports Corner Mondays with Chris Bibona USC football (6-1) dropped its first game of the season 43-42 against Utah on Saturday. Utes quarterback Cameron Rising scored five total touchdowns, three of which came on the ground. Caleb Williams matched his counterpart’s touchdown total, but it wasn’t enough to keep the Trojans undefeated. Utes tight end Dalton Kincaid wreaked havoc on the USC secondary. On 16 receptions, the 6-foot-4, 240-pound senior muscled a career-high 234 receiving yards and a touchdown. Rising moved the ball downfield in the air with ease, but the most crucial conversions the junior made were on the ground. On 4th-and-goal on the USC 1-yard line, Rising took the ball in himself to bring the game within one point with just 48 seconds left. Risking the game on a 2-point conversion rather than tying with an extra point, Rising again scrambled for the score, shedding two defenders and scoring the go-ahead points for Utah. After 1,118 yards of total offense between the Pac-12 rivals, Utah ultimately played spoiler and its fans were able to storm the field in celebration. USC dropped to No. 12 on the AP Poll, behind both No. 9 UCLA and No. 10 Oregon. The Trojans rest this Saturday with their week eight bye. In volleyball, the Women of Troy (15-4, 7-1) extended their winning streak to six games with a 3-1 victory over Oregon State on Sunday. Senior outside hitter Skylar Fields continues to lead the USC offense, this time with a team-high 23 kills. Sunday was the eighth consecutive game the transfer from University of Texas, Austin finished with over 20 kills. As of Oct. 14, Fields is seventh in the nation in kills per set. Looking forward, USC will embark on a four game road trip, starting with a match against Berkeley on Friday. In a highly anticipated clash between two men’s water polo titans, No. 2 Berkeley defeated No. 5 USC on Saturday. USC battled from behind the entire game, and even came as close as 11-10 with 1:55 left to play, but Cal rallied late to win 14-10. Graduate driver Massimo Di Martire led the Trojans with three goals, while graduate goalie Kyle McKenney covered with nine saves. In its next matchup, USC faces Pepperdine on Saturday in Malibu. In the world of pro sports: With a 5-3 win on Saturday, the San Diego Padres eliminated the Los Angeles Dodgers from the MLB postseason. A brief scroll of Dodgers Twitter will blame manager Dave Roberts, or maybe even GM Andrew Friedman. The fans want heads to roll — but the latest LA postseason breakdown just might fall on the star-studded roster worth roughly $333 million . With the exception of recent addition Freddie Freeman, who hit .357 in the NLDS, several starters failed to contribute offensively. Mookie Betts was just two for 14, Will Smith hit three for 16, while Trayce Thompson and Justin Turner only managed two for 13 in the playoffs. The Dodgers were embarrassed by ‘little brother’ San Diego, and the team’s scrappy, energetic roster. The Padres, led by MVP-candidate third baseman Manny Machado and outfielder Juan Soto, will play against the Philadelphia Phillies in the NLCS starting on Tuesday.

It’s Monday, and I’m reading about whether these TikTok-famous restaurants in Los Angeles are worth the hype. Onto the five USC, LA and California stories you need to know for today. Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Not that you need me to tell you, but there’s a storm system parked over LA right now. The downpour has already spurred mudslides, flooding and road closures in Studio City and Malibu, and officials warned of an “extremely dangerous situation” unfolding in Hollywood Hills. Downtown received a record-breaking four inches of rain yesterday, and most of the region is under a flash flood warning until 9 a.m. Nonstop showers are expected to continue until tomorrow. Staff / The New York Times 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC’s class of 2028 is expected to hit a record low 9.2% acceptance rate, just after the school broke into the single digits for the first time last year. Some 41,000 students applied under the early action deadline and another 40,800 applied for regular admission — a 1.2% increase in applications from last year. The 9.2% acceptance, by the way, puts us right with UCLA, though I wouldn’t be shocked if they have higher SAT scores than us. Sue me. Nathan Elias / Daily Trojan 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The race for California’s open Senate seat has at times gotten nasty, particularly between Reps. Katie Porter and Adam Schiff. Want nastier? Try the 47th District in Orange County, where Democrats Dave Min and Joanna Weiss are running to succeed Porter in the House. First, Weiss slammed Min for his DUI arrest last year in an attack ad. Then, Min accused Weiss of funding her campaign with money she and her husband earned defending sex offenders in court. The real winner, though, will likely be the Republican nominee, who’ll face a weakened Democrat in the purple district’s general election — and could determine control of the House. Melanie Mason / Politico 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Two years ago, a Bay Area elementary school with chronically low test scores paid $250,000 in federal money to Woke Kindergarten, a for-profit company that promises to train teachers to confront white supremacy and disrupt oppression: an alternative to traditional education, which some say is failing disadvantaged students. But two-thirds of the way into the program, test scores at Glassbrook Elementary School have fallen even lower. School officials defended Woke Kindergarten, arguing that the school was removed from the state watch list since starting the program — only to learn from journalists that the school was still on the list and had in fact dropped lower. Jill Tucker / San Francisco Chronicle 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] I want you to imagine a utopia with me: You’re cruising west on the Interstate 10, and there are no legal billboards. None. No Jacoby & Meyers. No Accidente. No Larry H Parker. You might not know that some 50 years ago, that utopia was a reality. The reason why there are so many personal injury advertisements in LA now is because in 1977, the California Supreme Court ruled in favor of then-upstarts Leonard Jacoby and Stephen Meyers on free speech grounds when they challenged the state bar’s decision to discipline them for “unethical advertising.” That paved the way for legal advertisements, which were previously unheard of, to flood the state.

It’s Tuesday, and I’ve seen some crazy visuals of the storm on Twitter. Two of my favorites: A man getting pulled out of the Los Angeles River by a helicopter crew , and a grand piano tossed out on the street after a mudslide. Onto the five USC, LA and California stories you need to know for today. Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Yesterday’s storm left at least two people dead and caused an estimated $9 to $11 billion in damage as an atmospheric river loitered over the state’s most densely populated regions. Nearly a million people were left without power and officials tallied over 100 mudslides. Downtown LA recorded 7.03 inches of rain, the third-wettest two-day stretch in its history. At USC, at least 11 buildings were damaged by rain and some professors scrambled to cancel classes. The storm is expected to leave the state by midweek. Jesse Ferrell / AccuWeather 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] California could determine control of the U.S. House. Pockets of conservative strength in the otherwise deep-blue state dot the Central Valley and Southern California suburbs, and those districts — especially ones that voted for Joe Biden in 2020 but still have a Republican representative — rank among a diminishing number of genuinely competitive swing districts nationwide. You don’t need to look very far: Republican Rep. Mike Garcia, who represents the suburbs north of LA, is facing a Democratic challenger after winning reelection by just 333 votes last cycle. Michael R. Blood / Associated Press 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Men’s basketball players at Dartmouth are considered university employees under federal labor law and thus have the right to unionize, the National Labor Relations Board ruled yesterday. It’s a potentially landmark ruling that could cause a legal “domino effect” across the country — especially at USC, which already faces a separate labor board complaint that it misclassifies athletes in the football and basketball programs as “student-athletes” rather than employees. That ruling is still pending, but experts say the school will need to justify athletes’ non-employee status given the revenue they generate. Caroline Anders and Helen Li / Semafor 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A California bill could legalize psychedelic-assisted therapy, an abridged version of a failed attempt last year to decriminalize drugs like psilocybin and mescaline across the board. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who vetoed the first bill, argued that lawmakers need to write regulated treatment guidelines before decriminalizing possession. Critics argue that “even talking about psychedelics decreases the perception of harm” and worry about teenagers buying “gray market” products. Proponents, including veteran groups, say psilocybin can help patients overcome PTSD. Anabel Sosa / Los Angeles Times 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Before this week’s storm hit, a frantic emergency preparedness enthusiast declared on Twitter that the coming deluge would be “the dreaded #ARkStorm,” a once-in-a-1,000-year theoretical event modeled by meteorologists that would swallow entire cities. The enthusiast was wrong, of course, but that didn’t stop her Tweet from going viral and stoking fears of a coming biblical storm. Meteorologists say it was just the latest instance of them needing to play “Whac-a-Mole” with online disinformation in the social media age. The enthusiast, for her part, wasn’t particularly apologetic. “I’m just a well-meaning chick on Twitter,” she said.

It’s Thursday, and the Charlie Kirk shitposting is getting out of hand . Onto the five USC, Los Angeles, and California stories you need to know for today. Share this with a friend 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Millions of Americans are in for a nasty awakening as the Biden-era pause on federal student loan payments comes to an end. One California woman only realized the moratorium was lifted when her credit score dropped by 100 points. Estimates show some 9 million people could be in the same boat. Staff / The Wall Street Journal 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] In case you missed it: References to DEI programs are quietly disappearing from USC websites. Pages that once promised to “promote institutional support for advocacy/activism at all levels” are gone. References to cultural student news outlets were scrubbed. And “DEI” was replaced with terms like “community and culture.” Tomo Chien / Morning, Trojan 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Cops raided Huntington Park City Hall and the homes of several local politicians as part of a corruption investigation. The probe centers around a still-unbuilt aquatic center that the city has somehow spent $14 million on, leading prosecutors to investigate allegations of bribery, money laundering, and conspiracy. Ruben Vives / Los Angeles Times 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A downtown barber has become something of a matchmaker after posting viral singles ads for his clients. Julian Saluta of TheGallery said some videos have landed his customers serious dates. Others, flings. Mostly, though, there’s a lot of internet drooling. “Does Brandon like older women?” one recent commenter asked. Gina Cherelus / The New York Times 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Bad news for nature lovers: This year’s dry winter will likely kill the chances of a decent wildflower bloom in Southern California. “We’re already hitting 82 in February,” said a state park manager. “It doesn&#39;t make the prospects very good for a decent bloom year.” In the meantime, you can reminisce the spectacular 2023 superbloom with these photos .

It’s Wednesday, and I’m reading about the guy who’s tasted everything on the Cheesecake Factory’s menu. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Students say USC’s free Lyft service is suffering from longer-than-usual wait times — and that’s leading some to walk alone at night. A USC official said that though there’s been a slight increase in recent wait times, nearly 9 in 10 riders wait no more than five minutes for their Lyft. It’s not clear why there’s an apparent shortage of drivers near campus, but it might be partially because Lyft has started offering fewer bonuses for drivers who complete rides in the area. Malieya Pittman / Annenberg Media 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] You’d think a city rocked by eight major scandals in a four-year span might be eager to enact new ethics rules. Turns out not. It’s been almost a year and a half since the LA City Council promised to give its ethics commission more power after scandals forced some members to resign and sent others to federal prison. The council has until July to propose new rules that’d be on the November ballot, but it’s yet to schedule a hearing for the legislation. And some councilmembers support an even lengthier process that would essentially punt reform to 2026. Frank Stoltze / LAist 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] An ex-LA County deputy alleged he was fired because he had a history of refusing to take part in deputy gang activity. In a lawsuit, the deputy said his colleagues filed bogus complaints that he gave a Nazi salute and shared a sexually explicit photo, and implied that the captain who decided to fire him — a deputy gang member himself — did so to punish him. The lawsuit is just the latest complaint to depict the department as an institution overrun by rogue bands of violent deputies who subvert the chain of command. Keri Blakinger / Los Angeles Times 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The Pacific Coast Highway keeps collapsing into the ocean, and state officials aren’t sure what to do about it. Strong storms and rising seas driven by climate change have led to growing damage along the scenic roadway, epitomized last weekend by a landslide that left 1,600 people stranded. There are solutions — they’re just expensive. Some include: Tunneling through the mountains that border the highway. Constructing a heavily engineered foundation under the road. Or peeling back the mountain to suspend the road on a bridge-like structure. Rachel Swan / San Francisco Chronicle 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Three armed guards sat in a California hotel room, watching a duffel bag of $400,000 in cash. They weren’t drug mules: They were moving money for a legal marijuana distributor who was forced to hire them because most banks won’t work with dispensaries. Banks are technically allowed to handle the money, but they’re subject to onerous federal reporting requirements that discourage them from doing it. Distributors say the policy is a thorn in their side that’s ultimately a boon for illegal sellers.

It’s Wednesday, and we’re reading about the 18 best budget-friendly restaurants in Los Angeles. And FYI — we’ll be taking a break for the fall recess and will see you next on Monday. Onto the five USC, LA and California stories you need to know for today. 1. A Tuesday night vigil at USC mourned the Israelis killed during attacks by the militant group Hamas this week. A smaller pro-Palestine group arrived midway through the vigil and silently held signs reading “Remember them too.” No conflict broke out between the two groups, but some students criticized the pro-Palestine group’s decision to attend and mask their identities. Terence Holton and Siena Maniatis / USC Annenberg Media 2. A U.S. sailor from Monterey Park admitted to selling sensitive information and documents to Chinese intelligence officers. Naval Petty Officer Wenheng Zhao pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring with a foreign intelligence office and another count of receiving a bribe for at least $15,000. He is expected to be sentenced on Jan. 8 for up to 20 years. Andrew J. Campa / Los Angeles Times 3. California will launch an “Ebony Alert” system in January, a version of Amber Alerts but for missing Black people ages 12 to 25. Black people go missing at disproportionate rates in the U.S., and studies show that they’re less likely than white people to get media attention when they go missing — something the Ebony Alert is meant to change. Char Adams / NBC 4. California residents will soon be able to request that data brokers delete all their personal information under a new law signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom. The state’s residents are currently entitled to ask individual companies to delete their data, but the new bill is expected to make that process much less tedious by combining everything into a single request. Johana Bhuiyan / The Guardian 5. Flag football, cricket, lacrosse and squash will all likely become Olympic sports when LA hosts the 2028 Summer Games. Officials say the addition of cricket could boost Olympic television rights in India by more than $100 million, and NFL officials have called flag football the “future of the game,” touting it as a more accessible version of the full-contact sport.

It’s Thursday, and we’re getting excited for the Festival of Books this weekend. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Two USC students who were injured by a falling roof tile on campus in January 2022 sued the university for negligence. Caileigh Gold and Qiong Wu, both graduate students at the School of Cinematic Arts, were filming a project near the Leventhal School of Accounting when the tile fell, striking Gold’s head and Wu’s arm. The suit alleges the students sustained severe injuries from the incident. Mateo Villalba-Mutis / Daily Trojan 2. Richard J. Riordan, former mayor of LA, died Wednesday at 92. Riordan was a businessman who ran as an outside candidate in 1993 and led the city’s rebound from the Rodney King riots a year prior. The moderate was the last Republican mayor of what has now become a liberal stronghold, and made an unsuccessful gubernatorial run after his tenure as mayor ended. Jean Merl / Los Angeles Times 3. Anti-critical race theory fever has reached California, with six school districts passing measures that restrict instruction about race. “Critical race theory” is boogeyman of sorts in K-12 schools: Nobody’s teaching the college-level theory about policies that perpetuate racial injustice to first-graders, so it’s more of a vague term having something to do with teaching about race and racism. Diana Lambert / EdSource 4. The fallout over a series of racist text messages sent between police officers in the Northern California city of Antioch continues to grow. The City Council this week voted to audit the department’s internal affairs, hiring practices and culture; Rev. Al Sharpton called on the U.S. Department of Justice to protect the city’s mayor, who was the target of suggested violence in some of the texts; and angry residents continue taking to the streets to demand firings. Judith Prieve and Rick Hurd / The Mercury News 5. LA County could have to spend up to $3 billion to resolve claims of sexual abuse at its facilities, officials told the county Board of Supervisors. The estimated 3,000 claims stem from a state law that grants victims of childhood sexual assault additional time to file lawsuits, many of which originate from the infamous MacLaren Children’s Center.

And now, onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. California’s 2024 Senate race will be an expensive one; probably one of the most expensive ever. But as outside super-PAC money flows into the coffers of Democratic heavyweights vying to succeed Sen. Dianne Feinstein, perhaps the biggest question on the minds of pundits is whether candidates will revert to negative broadsides that deepen intraparty strife — or steer clear of the drama. Jeremy B. White / Politico 2. Experts say much of the state should see its water supplies replenished by this year’s wet weather, though that’s highly dependent on the region. For instance, the Central Valley, which gets most of its water from aquifers, will likely see little change because it’ll take years of rain to recharge groundwater supplies; but the Bay Area, which relies on reservoirs, should be in good shape. Kurtis Alexander / San Francisco Chronicle 3. The Thornton music complex was closed indefinitely on Monday while crews worked to restore power after rain flooded the building’s mechanical room and blew the main transformer. A Thornton official said the school hopes the building will reopen by the end of the week. In the meantime, professors will hold class virtually or in alternative classrooms. Staff / Annenberg Media 4. A new state program is reconsidering the potential of work-study jobs, subsidizing internships that allow students to work in jobs that’ll give them a leg up in their careers. That’s in contrast to traditional work-study programs, which largely see students working in university service jobs that have little to do with their desired post-college career. Emma Gallegos / EdSource 5. California’s COVID state of emergency winds down Tuesday, nearly three years after Gov. Gavin Newsom issued the first stay-at-home order at the onset of the pandemic — and just days after the state tallied 100,000 total COVID-related deaths. The emergency’s expiration will have little practical bearing on the state, which has largely returned to the pre-pandemic order. Adam Beam / Associated Press You’re all caught up.

It’s Thursday, and I’m reading about how a legendary California road trip spot — Pea Soup Andersen’s off Highway 101 — is closing . The Interstate 5 location is still open, though. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] You can read (or watch) an old ABC 10 profile on the quirky restaurant, or make your own version of the Danish soup. I’ll try the recipe next week and let you know how it goes. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] An avalanche at a Lake Tahoe ski resort left one person dead and three injured on Wednesday morning. The Placer County Sheriff’s office identified the fatality as Kenneth Kidd, 66, who lived in Point Reyes and Truckee. Search and rescue teams recovered four people from the avalanche and concluded their search by the end of the day. The resort will reopen this morning, though the area where the avalanche occurred will remain closed as authorities investigate its cause. Staff / San Francisco Chronicle 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Meta claimed that it’ll stop pushing harmful content to teens on Facebook and Instagram. No-go topics include suicide, self harm, eating disorders, guns, drugs, sex toys and nudity. The changes, which will roll out over the next few months, come amid increased scrutiny of the tech giant. In May, the U.S. surgeon general warned that social media platforms need to take “immediate action to protect kids now,” and in August, California joined a group of more than 40 states in a lawsuit accusing Meta of using “psychologically manipulative product features” to attract young users. Terry Castleman / Los Angeles Times 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] California is staring down the barrel of a $38 billion budget deficit, a remarkable change of fortune from a nearly $100 billion surplus just two years ago. Gov. Gavin Newsom asked state lawmakers to pull some $13 billion from general reserves and delay or cut spending to cover the rest of the shortfall. Climate programs will take the biggest hit, though Newsom said he’d leave homelessness and mental health initiatives intact. Blake Jones / Politico 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A group of USC students is pressuring the university to cut all ties with the fossil fuel industry, arguing that its commitment to divest from oil and gas over the next several years is not enough. The students, part of the Environmental Student Assembly, say USC’s petroleum engineering program, which trains fossil fuel engineers, is “unacceptable.” “We still have … faculty who have ties with Chevron who are now teaching or doing research here [and] professors’ research being influenced by funding from Chevron,” one student said. Zachary Whalen / Daily Trojan 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] An LA burger chain manager who used “straw donors” to contribute to former Sheriff Alex Villanueva’s 2018 campaign will pay a $50,000 fine for campaign money laundering. After maxing out his legal donation limit, Manuel Gomez, who owns Tam’s Super Burgers, supplied intermediaries with cash then wrote contribution checks in their names. State investigators said they found no evidence that Villanueva knew about the contributions.

Here are the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Nearly 200,000 people in LA County collectively owe a whopping half a billion dollars in unpaid rent. The figure reflects a dire state for many renters as pandemic-era eviction protections begin to expire, most notably LA County’s, which is one of the last remaining local protections and expires on March 31. Alejandra Reyes-Velarde / CalMatters 2. California lawmakers approved a bill that will allow regulators to punish oil companies who gouge prices at the pump. The bill, the first of its kind in the nation, has long been a top priority for Gov. Gavin Newsom and should in theory stop companies from profiting from gas prices spikes like those of last summer. Adam Beam / Associated Press 3. USC’s acceptance rate for the 2022-2023 admissions season was 11.5%, a 0.5% decrease from the previous year. First-generation college students make up 23% of the admitted applicants, and the school set a record for the highest volume of applicants ever — 80,790, which is 10,000 higher than the previous record. Jennifer Nehrer / Daily Trojan 4. LA city workers took down the controversial fence that surrounded Echo Park, two years after officials closed the park for renovations — which, as some advocates have alleged, may have been a thinly veiled effort to clear the park’s 200-person homeless encampment at the height of the pandemic. Staff / City News Service 5. Scientists named a rare beetle species in honor of Jerry Brown, former governor of California. Bembidion brownorum is a brown beetle about 1/5 inch in length that, until recently, hadn’t been seen since 1966. Brown (the human) left office in 2019. Staff / Associated Press You’re all caught up.

Have a great summer."},{"slug":"the-students-are-fuming","title":"The students are fuming","date":1674749183000,"web_exclusive":false,"content":"*|MC_PREVIEW_TEXT|* View this email in your browser By Tomoki Chien NEWSLETTER EDITOR Good morning, I hope you’re having a good week. Here are the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Students are furious. Angry. Fuming. But this time it’s not because of tuition hikes or another abhorrent university scandal: USC’s Free Lyft program now offers shared rides instead of private ones — a return to pre-pandemic policy — forcing students to wait longer for rides and make conversation with (or else otherwise ignore) fellow students, not just a driver. Staff / Annenberg Media 2. The LA County Board of Supervisors extended its eviction moratorium another two months through the end of March. The move applies to unincorporated areas and cities without their own moratorium — including the city of LA, whose own such policy expires Feb. 1. Rebecca Ellis / Los Angeles Times 3. One of every nine tanks of gas, diesel and jet fuel pumped in California come from the Amazon rainforest; in fact, half of all the rainforest’s exported crude comes to this state. Why? The two regions produce similar kinds of heavy oil, which means California refineries are well-equipped for Amazonian crude. Catrin Einhorn / The New York Times 4. Prosecutors charged the suspected Half Moon Bay shooter with a raft of felonies, including a special circumstance that opens the possibility of the death sentence. 66-year-old Chunli Zhao is accused of murdering seven people at two different farms with a semiautomatic handgun. Rachel Swan and Matthias Gafni / San Francisco Chronicle 5. USC students can’t find eggs. Trader Joe’s in the Village almost never has them — as if that wasn’t already a given — but expect to shell out between five and seven bucks if you manage to scoop a carton at Ralph’s or Target. You can blame the bird flu coupled with rising fuel and packaging costs for the shortage. Staff / Annenberg Media You’re all caught up. Thanks for reading Morning, Trojan, and have a good day.

The Oct. 22 weekend edition 🗞 The Rylan Report Weekly updates on my roommate, Rylan. Please give Rylan thumbs up for: washing his hands. Most of the time. 👍 Thumbs down for: Casually mentioning the other day that he’s accumulated a total of three parking tickets this semester. This is after I warned him that he really maybe shouldn’t park in a structure that he doesn’t have a permit for. “Nah, they won’t even check, they’re chill,” he said at the time. Well, check they did. Apparently the tickets are for a mix of improperly displaying the permit and failing to display the permit in the first place. “Such a stupid rule,” he said. 👎 Thumbs up for: I haven’t heard of that OnlyFans venture in a while, which I’m assuming means either (a) it’s no longer happening or (b) he’s gotten smart enough to keep his mouth shut lest it end up again in the next Rylan Report. Honestly, I’m fine either way. 👍 Thumbs down for: Leaving his dirty yogurt spoons in the sink for me to wash. 👎 Thumbs up for: Brushing his teeth — this one actually isn’t sarcastic at all, surprisingly. The man will stand over the sink for, I kid you not, five minutes every morning and night just brushing his teeth. (I’ve timed it.) I wondered whether the duration of tooth brushing correlates with whether or not he’s seeing his girlfriend that day, but it doesn’t at all. (I graphed it.) Nice work Rylan. 👍 📰 Editor’s note I’m keeping today’s weekend edition pretty short, just because I’m spending a lot of time revamping Morning, Trojan’s visuals.

It’s Tuesday, and I’m stoked for the Ellendale beer mile . Onto the five USC, Los Angeles, and California stories you need to know for today. Share this with a friend 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A frat that once encouraged pledges to fight each other for spectator sport and engage in the “Great American Challenge” of downing a 30-pack plus weed and pizza just returned from a six-year suspension. This time around, Theta Xi swears it won’t do “hazing and sexual assault and all that stuff.” Asiana Guang and Karthik Krishnamurthy / Daily Trojan 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Elsewhere on the Row, Lambda Chi Alpha held a vigil for Soren Dixon, the sophomore who died in a car crash over the Thanksgiving break. In a statement, Dixon’s family described him as a “kind, gentle soul,” and a resident of his hometown said that “everyone is feeling incredibly impacted by this terrible accident.” Staff / Annenberg Media 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A California-based startup is offering insurance for stolen packages — an unorthodox protection against holiday porch pirates. PorchPals charges $120 a year and will cover up to $2,000 of stolen deliveries over three claims. There’s no deductible. Imani Moise / The Wall Street Journal 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] California Democrats are grappling between taking on Donald Trump and focusing on pocketbook issues — which were widely seen as the party’s weakness in this year’s election. Some passionate legislators want to prepare lawsuits against the White House. Others want to do “real policy work.” Mackenzie Mays / Los Angeles Times 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Trumpies, once skeptical of electric cars, are going all in on Tesla thanks to Elon Musk’s partisan flip-flop . One dude not only bought a Model Y but invested his family’s entire retirement fund in Tesla stock because he wants to “reward a leader like that.” Elon is surely thankful.

It’s Thursday, and it’s National Burrito Day. Here’s where you can find the deals. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Thieves stole as much as $30 million from a San Fernando Valley money storage facility, an Italian Job -esque heist that’s one of the largest in LA history. The burglars, who are still at large, likely broke into the building Sunday night through the roof — but it’s not clear how they avoided the alarm system. The vault appeared untouched from the outside, and facility managers were none the wiser until Monday. Richard Winton / Los Angeles Times 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] San Bernardino County deputies shot and killed a teenager with mental health issues who was armed with a knife. The 17-year-old boy was a foster youth who escaped a mental health facility and arrived at a home where his sisters live. Somebody called the police, and when deputies arrived, he locked himself in a bathroom and threatened to cut himself. Deputies broke down the door and a scuffle ensued. He was dead by the end of it. It was the second time the deputies have killed a teenager in the last month. Abené Clayton / The Guardian 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] California’s new $20 fast food minimum wage has stirred its fair share of outrage. But a key effect — other than the fact you’ll have to pay $1.80 more for a Whopper meal — is that it just got a lot harder for schools to find cafeteria workers. Cafeteria staff, who aren’t covered by the new law, are historically some of the lowest-paid employees in public education. That’s left schools scrambling to offer raises and other incentives in an effort to avoid a mass exodus of workers to now higher-paying service jobs. Adam Beam / Associated Press 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Consider adding Bakersfield to your bucket list: It’s where many fast food restaurants test new menu items before releasing them to the broader market. Taco Bell, Del Taco, Carl’s Jr. and Wienerschnitzel all participate, and fast food connoisseurs from across California flock to be the guinea pigs for the new items. But the products aren’t necessarily good: Take Wienerschnitzel’s “Sea Dog,” which a writer said “wasn’t the worst thing I’d ever eaten” but was “by far the hardest.” Andrew Pridgen / SFGate 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] An AIDS foundation posted a billboard near Coachella directing festival goers to an STD testing site if they “catch more than vibes.” Coachella organizers are pissed. The billboard, they say, is copyright infringement, apparently because it features a photo of the festival and uses its color scheme. They threatened legal action unless the billboard is torn down, but the foundation’s president was defiant. “Do they really not know how people spend their time during festival weekends?” she said.

Here are the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Authorities warned thousands of Central Valley residents to leave their homes ahead of another heavy storm expected Wednesday. The new weather system is forecasted to drop an additional 4 inches of rain on a community that has suffered flooding and infrastructure damage from more than a dozen back-to-back deluges. Ian James and Paige St. John / Los Angeles Times 2. The White House is set to approve new California restrictions that would phase out diesel-burning trucks. The rules — significantly more ambitious than anything at the federal level — mandate emissions cuts for heavy-duty vehicles starting in the 2024 model year and aim to reach zero emissions by 2045. Anna Philips / The Washington Post 3. The LA Unified School District failed to avert a three-day strike scheduled for Tuesday in a Hail Mary legal effort, but a state labor board could still in theory halt the strike on Monday. In the Hail Mary effort, the school district argued that the strike was illegal because the stated justification isn’t the real reason for the walkout; a labor board tossed that argument. Howard Blume / Los Angeles Times 4. California high schools are embroiled in a divisive debate over the state’s ethnic studies requirement, in part because the state has left it up to individual school districts to decide their own curricula. One camp argues that classes should focus on the root causes of white supremacy, racism and patriarchy; the other argues that doing so will only teach pupils to hate each other. Jill Tucker / San Francisco Chronicle 5. California will partner with a generic drug maker to produce affordable, state-branded insulin in an effort to force other manufacturers to lower the cost of the medication. Questions remain: The partners still need to find a manufacturing facility. They also need to secure regulatory approvals. And competitors could still undercut the state product — though perhaps that’s the point. Michael R. Blood / Associated Press You’re all caught up.

Mayor Karen Bass’ Inside Safe homelessness program is failing to provide the City Council its mandated biweekly transparency reports, potentially raising questions as the mayor looks to budget another $250 million for her signature effort. Figures show that Bass is about a quarter of the way to her goal of housing 17,000 Angelenos in her first year. Nick Gerda / LAist 2. A former UCLA doctor was sentenced to 11 years in prison after being convicted of sexually abusing patients in cases dating back to the late aughts. 66-year-old James Heaps worked part-time as an OB-GYN at UCLA Health, a healthcare system linked to the university, for nearly three decades before being terminated in response to allegations of sexual misconduct. Christine Hauser / The New York Times 3. COVID levels in LA County wastewater samples are on the rise, likely due to the arrival of the new Arcturus subvariant. The strain currently makes up an estimated 10% of U.S. cases and is thought to cause pinkeye, a previously rare symptom. State health officials warned people not to dismiss itchy, watery or red eyes as seasonal allergies and to take an at-home test if experiencing those symptoms. Rong-Gong Lin II / Los Angeles Times 4. State lawmakers approved the nation’s first emissions regulations for trains, including bans on locomotive engines more than 23 years old by 2030 and on idling if a train is equipped with an automatic shutoff. The Biden administration — which has a history of green-lighting California climate policies — still needs to approve the regulations because they’re stricter than federal law. Sophie Austin / Associated Press 5. USC wide receiver Jordan Addison was selected 23rd overall by the Minnesota Vikings in the first round of the NFL draft.

It’s Friday, and I’m reading about how to watch the solar eclipse on Monday. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC officials shut down one of the school’s main walkways to make room for rapper Travis Scott as he visited campus to promote his line of collegiate-branded apparel. The merch drop — which garnered a comically massive line of students, some whom even camped overnight — caused pedestrian traffic jams around campus and a general headache for anybody not interested in a pair of $140 sweatpants. Thankfully, though, Scott prepared some astute words to share at our prestigious educational institution: “Study don’t jack off,” he wrote in one autograph. Henry Kofman / Daily Trojan 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A driver crashed through a wall on the third floor of the McCarthy Way Parking Structure, prompting officials to temporarily shut down the garage and direct pedestrians to avoid the sidewalk directly under the crash. Photos showed the wall split in two, hanging over the edge of the structure. No injuries were reported, and officials reopened the garage just a few hours after the incident. Talia Wexler / Daily Trojan 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Police spent five hours in a standoff with a suspect who allegedly burglarized a USC student’s apartment then barricaded himself in a nearby home. The man broke several windows and may have started a small fire, prompting firefighters to visit the scene on West 30th Street between Shrine Place and Royal Street to extinguish the blaze. The suspect surrendered around 11 p.m., and no injuries were reported. Danielle Radin / KCAL News 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] If you think your vote doesn’t count, a House race in Silicon Valley might make you reconsider. In California, only the top two candidates in the primary election move onto the general contest. But this is no ordinary case: Two candidates are locked at exactly 30,249 votes each for second place, and both will advance to a three-way election in November. While rare, the result isn’t entirely unprecedented. The race for a state Assembly seat in 2016 had three candidates on the general ballot due to a similar tie vote. Guy Marzorati / KQED 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] For years, a familiar story has floated about Gov. Gavin Newsom: He grew up with dyslexia, making him a poor student who struggled in school. But his saving grace was that he was good at baseball, which helped secure him a spot at Santa Clara University, giving him a chance to make something of himself. And he was so good that he even got drafted by the Texas Rangers. Turns out that’s a bit of a stretch. The governor never appeared on Santa Clara’s roster, and his powerful father’s connections are actually what got him into the school. And he might’ve been scouted by the Rangers, but he certainly wasn’t drafted.

Karen Bass defeated businessman Rick Caruso in the Los Angeles mayoral race, becoming the first woman and only second Black Angeleno ever elected to lead the city. Caruso outspent Bass by more than 11 to 1 in his bid for the mayorship. Julia Wick / Los Angeles Times 2. California is facing a projected $25 billion deficit next fiscal year as tax revenues fall short and the broader economy seems headed for a slowdown. The Legislature’s fiscal analysts recommended that the state, which not long ago reveled in a record budget surplus, pare back on spending rather than dip into reserves. Climate projects have historically been the first to go during economic downturns. Blake Jones and Lara Korte / Politico 3. Twenty five LA County sheriff’s recruits were injured when an SUV veered into the wrong lane and plowed through their early-morning training run on Wednesday morning. Five were critically injured. Amy Taxin, John Antczak and Jae C. Hong / Associated Press 4. Nurse practitioners in California will soon be allowed to treat patients without physician supervision, a move which could expand healthcare access in low-income communities. Practitioners must meet certain time requirements to apply to work without physician supervision, but only in facilities where at least one doctor or surgeon also practices; after three years, those practitioners can work with full independence, and in theory even open their own medical practices. Ana B. Ibarra / CalMatters 5. Harvey Weinstein’s defense attorneys are attempting to drag Gov. Gavin Newsom into the spotlight in a bid to discredit his wife, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, who testified that Weinstein raped her in 2005. Weinstein’s lawyers said that Newsom accepted donations from the former Hollywood mogul — but Siebel Newsom said that was before she explicitly told her husband that Weinstein raped her. A judge tossed the defense’s request to bring up Newsom’s ill-fated trip to the French Laundry during the pandemic. Sophia Bollag / San Fransisco Chronicle 6. The University of California Board of Regents will decide Thursday whether to block UCLA’s switch to the Big Ten Conference. A move to the Big Ten — which would mirror USC’s Pac-12 defection and bring UCLA a more lucrative television contract — would mean more travel time for athletes and that UC Berkeley would have to stomach a loss of millions in revenue if the Pac-12 can’t deliver the LA market in its next television deal. Billy Witz / The New York Times 7. Rolling Loud, the world’s largest hip-hop festival, will take place in Inglewood at Hollywood Park adjacent to SoFi Stadium in March.

Share this with a friend 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Reggie Bush is getting his Heisman Trophy back. The former USC football star, considered one of the century’s most transcendent college athletes, was forced to forfeit his 2005 most-valuable-player award when investigators accused him of accepting cash and gifts that violated NCAA rules. But the college athletics landscape has changed drastically since then. Athletes can now profit off of their name, image and likeness, and an athlete minimum wage has begun to seem inevitable . The Heisman trust cited those changes in reinstating Bush’s trophy. Pete Thamel / ESPN 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A fight that left one teen dead near a South LA high school has renewed the debate over the role of police in schools. In 2020, the LA Unified School District slashed its police budget and promised to minimize the presence of officers in and around campuses — and instead started relying on unarmed staff and volunteers. But in a fight last week, one such unarmed adult was heard on video saying: “I’m not breaking up shit. I don’t give a fuck” before a student pulled a gun and shot another to death. Howard Blume / Los Angeles Times 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Tensions over the Israel-Hamas war continue to swell at California college campuses. At UC Berkeley, pro-Palestinian protesters are digging in for their second day of camping on the school’s main plaza. Stanford students staged a massive rally earlier this week. And in the state’s far north, Cal Poly Humbolt had to shut down its campus after protesters barricaded themselves in at least two buildings and got in physical confrontations with police officers. Nanette Asimov / San Francisco Chronicle 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The LA County Board of Supervisors strongly opposed a plan to deploy helicopter-borne sharpshooters to gun down invasive deer on Catalina Island. Supervisors called the plan — which was proposed by Catalina officials — “inhumane” and “potentially dangerous to the public.” But ecologists on the island contend that the aerial solution is the only way to effectively eradicate the deer before they irreversibly damage the island’s native ecosystem.

( Benjamin Papp and Claire Qiu / Daily Trojan ) 🌴 In L.A. In an extraordinary move, the state attorney general booted the L.A. County Sheriff’s Department from a politically charged investigation into county Supervisor Sheila Kuehl. Last week, the sheriff’s department carried out an early morning raid of Kuehl’s home as part of a purported investigation into whether Kuehl pushed L.A. Metro to award a contract to a close friend’s nonprofit. Kuehl — a vocal critic of Sheriff Alex Villanueva — alleged that Villanueva is using a secretive public corruption unit to hit his political enemies. ( Jason Henry / Daily News ) The hackers who targeted the L.A. Unified School District computer system have made a ransom demand. Such a demand typically indicates that hackers have either extracted sensitive information — or are pulling a bluff. District officials have repeatedly said that they believe the hackers extracted no sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers or health records. ( Howard Blume / Los Angeles Times ) A Culver City fire left 17 cats dead and sent one firefighter to the hospital over the weekend. It took 124 firefighters over an hour to extinguish the fire, which smoldered multiple businesses including CatPlaceLA, a cat hotel. ( Rachel Barnes / Patch ) A Chapman student died on a USC student-run film set earlier this year. Now, his family is suing. The parents of Peng Weng allege that the university green-lit the film project knowing that that the students would use off-road vehicles in the desert — Weng died when one of those vehicles rolled — in its wrongful-death lawsuit filed against the school and two of its students. The university said that it was unaware of the project’s details prior to the accident.

I sent this out about a month ago, but just want to again link to this story in Annenberg Media about scammers duping USC students with fake football tickets — play it smart for the Cal game. And now, here’s the news you need to know for today. 1. Gov. Gavin Newsom rejected every California local government’s plan to address homelessness, asserting that the “unacceptable” proposals would only reduce homelessness in California by 2% over four years. Big-city mayors said that Newsom’s decision came with little notice and undermined their efforts to curb the statewide crisis. Jeremy White / Politico 2. State Attorney General Rob Bonta isn’t convinced that plastic bag producers are following the law. Per a 2014 senate bill, all plastic bags sold in California are required to be recyclable at in-state facilities; Bonta said that manufactures may be producing products without making sure that the proper recycling infrastructure is in place. Kurtis Alexander / San Francisco Chronicle 3. Retired Long Beach Police Chief Robert Luna appeared solidify his lead over incumbent Alex Villanueva in the Los Angeles County sheriff’s race, recent polling showed. A UC Berkeley poll found that 40% of likely voters and people who already voted have chosen Luna, while 32% are voting for Villanueva. 28% remain undecided with the Nov. 8 election just days away. Alene Tchekmedyian / Los Angeles Times 4. A workers’ strike in Orange County left thousands of riders without bus service on Thursday. The union, Teamsters Local 952, is negotiating for a more favorable wage increase from the county transportation authority. Staff / Associated Press 5. Rep. Karen Bass has an impressive slate of endorsements in the L.A. mayoral race, but she’s missing a big one: Gov. Gavin Newsom. The governor’s endorsement is a conspicuous absence among Bass’ supporters from the likes of President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, Hillary Clinton, Sen. Bernie Sanders and former President Barack Obama. Sources say that Newsom’s reluctance might stem from his personal relationship with — and past campaign contributions from — Rick Caruso, Bass’ challenger. Lara Korte / Politico 6. Nearly 50,000 University of California student workers voted to go on strike as soon as Nov. 14 in a move that could hobble academic research and instruction across the university system. The coalition of researchers, postdocs, teaching assistants and graders are calling for increased wages, better working conditions and affordable housing. Shaanth Kodialam / Daily Bruin 7.

Trump, who has decried “wokeness” and “jihadism” on college campuses, could conceivably withhold funding or levy taxes to achieve those goals. Vimal Patel and Sharon Otterman / The New York Times 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] NCAA officials put USC football on probation after finding it violated a limit on the number of coaches a team can employ. The finding will amount to little more than a $50,000 slap on the wrist for USC, which the NCAA lauded for its “collaborative” tone during the investigation. Ryan Kartje / Los Angeles Times 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] LA County voters approved a historic measure that’ll nearly double the number of supervisors on its governing board. Advocates say the expansion will lead to better governance and temper the immense power that individual supervisors wield; each of today’s five represents a staggering 2 million people. Helen Jeong / NBC Los Angeles 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Americans have consumed copious amounts of alcohol ever since the pandemic, a USC study found.

Though temporary, the moratorium has spooked academia. Universities rely heavily on generous government funding, and worry this could portend a calamitous four years. “I’d summarize it as: fuck,” said one U.S. university administrator. Ian Bogost / The Atlantic 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A brief rainstorm broke downtown LA’s 264-day dry spell and brought chaos to parts of the region.

If you didn’t watch this weekend’s game, here’s a quick recap of USC’s 56-10 blowout win over Stanford . Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. X Corp., formerly known as Twitter, sued California over a law that requires social media platforms to disclose their content moderation policies. The suit claims that the law — an effort to tamp down on online toxic discourse that sailed through the Legislature last year — violates social media companies’ free speech rights because it seeks to pressure platforms into limiting content that “the state apparently finds objectionable or undesirable.” Eric He / Politico 2. A small group of LA Unified School District employees collected over $750,000 in mostly improperly approved extra pay over a three-year span. It’s not uncommon for public employees, particularly first responders like police and firefighters, to earn large sums of overtime pay. But auditors said that LAUSD staff charged extra for tasks that were part of regular duties and often improperly filled out overtime request forms — and that they were aided by lax enforcement from top administrators. Howard Blume / Los Angeles Times 3. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she’ll run for reelection in Congress in 2024, quelling any talk of the 83-year-old’s retirement. The San Francisco leader of over 35 years said she was motivated by the need to help her city in recovery and push House Democrats to regain their majority in an election season where she believes democracy hangs in the balance. Lisa Mascaro / Associated Press 4. California schools are desperately trying to coax chronically absent students back into the classroom. Nearly a third of the state’s public school students were consistently tardy and truant in the 2021-2022 school year, an all-time high that was three times the pre-pandemic rate. Now, lawmakers and school officials are scrambling to enact policies that might reverse the trend before experts say it’s too late. Carolyn Jones / CalMatters 5. Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill that will make the wording on ballots easier to understand — changing “yes” or “no” to “keep” or “overturn a law”— and require referendums to list their funders. Lawmakers said they pushed for the reforms after seeing corporations use loopholes and confusing language to override laws and undo policies, especially in low-income communities of color.

Check out the Daily Trojan’s photo essay on Lunar New Year festivities across the city. (Annenberg Media unfortunately didn’t put one together!) You can also see my photos specifically of the beautiful Thien Hau Temple ceremony I took for that photo essay. And now, here are the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Seven people were shot dead near Half Moon Bay, marking the second California mass shooting in three days. The suspect, 67-year-old Zhao Chunli, allegedly murdered victims at two separate agricultural sites in front of other farmworkers and children. Staff / The New York Times 2. Authorities are piecing together a fragmented picture of Huu Can Tran, the suspect in the Monterey Park massacre. Friends and neighbors described him as a “private” man at his happiest when dancing, while investigators focused on Tran’s prior associations with the dance studios he targeted and whether jealousy over a relationship prompted the shooting. Staff / Los Angeles Times 3. A class-action lawsuit alleged that USC is responsible for the loss of millions in employee retirement savings. University employees and retirees filed the suit in 2016 — alleging the losses stemmed from negligent management of two retirement funds — but the eight-day trial starts today. Bianca B. Arźan-Montañez / Daily Trojan 4. One person was killed and seven were left injured after a shooting at an Oakland gas station just hours after the Half Moon Bay murders. Police arriving at the scene found shell casings but no victims, later discovering that all had transported themselves to the hospital. Jill Tucker / San Francisco Chronicle 5. Gov. Gavin Newsom put multiple flood protection projects on hold in proposed budget cuts to remedy the state’s $22.5 billion deficit. But that move came prior to the devastating floods earlier this month, which have prompted renewed scrutiny from environmental advocates and could very well force Newsom's administration to rethink those cuts.

The 76-year-old is accused of, among other things, taking unnecessary photos of patients’ genitals, barring chaperones from being present during exams and commenting on patients’ sexual history, nipples and pubic hair between 2009 and 2016. He faces 18 felony counts of sexual penetration of an unconscious person and nine felony counts of sexual battery by fraud. Eva Hartman / Daily Trojan 2. Freshman wideout Zachariah Branch was the star of USC’s 56-28 blowout win over San Jose State, notching 232 all-purpose yards and two touchdowns — one being an electric 96-yard kickoff return. Branch, the highest ranked receiver in his high school class, overshadowed even the Heisman-winning Caleb Williams through most of the game. The Trojans will take on the Nevada Wolf Pack on Saturday. Thuc Nhi Nguyen / Los Angeles Times 3. A large brawl broke out at a Torrance mall on Sunday afternoon, involving dozens, possibly hundreds, of juveniles running around the mall fighting in groups. Police are unsure of the cause, but similar brawls broke out in movie theaters in the Bay Area, Stockton, Indiana, Boston, upstate New York and New Hampshire; the Torrance fight started near the mall’s AMC theater. Jaysha Patel / ABC 7 4. Mark Ridley-Thomas, the disgraced former LA politician, will be sentenced in a federal court Monday. In March, Ridley-Thomas was convicted of seven felonies related to a scheme in which he extracted benefits from USC while sitting on the county Board of Supervisors. Prosecutors have requested a six-year prison sentence. Matt Hamilton / Los Angeles Times 5. California won the Little League World Series 6-5 over Curaco, a small island off the coast of Venezuela. The international youth baseball competition for 10- to 12-year-olds takes place annually in Pennsylvania and apparently generates enough excitement for every major news outlet in the United States to cover it. “This is a unique feeling that maybe only five or less people experience in their lifetime,” said Louis Lappe of team California, describing his walk-off homer in the championship game.

Michele Laufik / BizBash 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A staggering 576 California officials have been convicted on federal corruption charges over the last decade. Analysts blamed a “unique cauldron of factors” for LA’s particularly pertinent problem, including the Democratic party’s uncontested dominance and the immense amount of power vested in individual politicians. Ralph Vartabedian / The New York Times 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC promised to “comply with state law” if Gov. Gavin Newsom signs a bill that tries to coerce schools to end legacy admissions.

This will be the last newsletter of the week before we head into the Thanksgiving break, FYI. And now, here are the USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today — plus some from the nation and world. 1. The man who ran over a group of LA County sheriff’s cadets denied that it was an intentional attack, saying he fell asleep at the wheel — contrary to what Sheriff Alex Villanueva asserted last week. One deputy is on life support while another three remain hospitalized in “critical” condition. City New Service 2. Gov. Gavin Newsom released $1 billion in state homeless funds that he froze earlier this month. The governor had previously frustrated local leaders by withholding the funds meant to tackle California’s homelessness crisis, saying their plans weren’t ambitious enough. Marisa Kendall / The Mercury News 3. University of California academic workers are back at the second week of their strike after reportedly making headway in weekend negotiations over health benefits and workplace security for international students. The university system hasn’t budged much on wages, though. Ally Markovich and Iris Kwok / Berkeleyside 4. The Biden administration approved $1.1 billion in conditional funding that could keep the aging Diablo Canyon Power Plant operational past its scheduled 2025 shutdown. Gov. Newsom has been one of the plant’s biggest proponents, arguing that it’ll buy California time as it transitions to green power sources and grapples with energy challenges in the climate crisis. Gabrielle Canon / The Guardian 5. Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta is investigating whether hospital software programs divert more attention and resources to white patients than minorities, exacerbating racial disparities in healthcare. Mark Kreidler / Kaiser Health News Nation / world By Anna Hsu CONTRIBUTOR At least 162 people died after a 5.6-magnitude earthquake hit Indonesia, while rescue workers are still racing to reach victims under the rubble. ( Reuters ) An SUV plowed through the glass front window of an Apple store in a Boston suburb, killing one and wounding more than a dozen. ( The New York Times ) A major railroad union voted against a new wage deal from the White House, although union leaders are cautiously optimistic that they can settle a deal before workers begin to strike. ( The Wall Street Journal ) Graduation rates in Alabama and West Virginia impressively skyrocketed over the last decade. ( The Washington Post ) Thirty eight people died in a fire at an industrial wholesaler company in Henan Province, China; the cause of the fire is still unknown. ( Associated Press ) Other reads Tomo’s picks: “What Does an SAT Score Mean Anymore?” ( New York ) Anna’s picks: “How Wild Turkeys Find Love” ( The New York Times ) In case you missed it San Francisco launched a guaranteed income program for transgender residents.

It’s Friday, and I’m reading about how a landslide in San Clemente indefinitely shut down Metrolink and Amtrak service between Orange and San Diego counties. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The University of California tabled a plan that would allow undocumented students to work campus jobs, noting that the proposal’s legal pathway is “not viable at this time” and “carries significant risks” for the university. The Biden administration had quietly objected to the plan, which is at odds with federal law, and UC officials had grown increasingly skeptical that they could enact the policy without facing lawsuits. The decision means some 4,000 undocumented students can’t hold campus jobs, including paid fellowships and residencies that some need to graduate. Blake Jones / Politico 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A gunman fired on a moving Metrolink train in Antelope Valley, hospitalizing two people and riddling the train with bullet holes Wednesday evening. Authorities said the two injured people were standing outside the train when they were shot, one in the hip and the other in the calf. Their injuries weren’t life-threatening, and sheriff’s deputies are still searching for the shooter. Anthony De Leon / Los Angeles Times 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] LA County will pay $5 million to an election software executive who was arrested in 2022 for allegedly mishandling voter data in a case the district attorney dropped just five weeks later, citing “potential bias in the presentation” of evidence. Eugene Yu, 66, co-founder of Konnech, was swept up in a right-wing conspiracy theory after the 2020 election that accused his company of storing voter data on Chinese servers. Yu repeatedly denied the claims. Stuart A. Thompson / The New York Times 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] In-N-Out Burger will close a location for the first time in its 75-year history, citing a crime wave at its sole Oakland restaurant. Since 2019, police have logged 1,335 incidents in the vicinity of the burger joint, which sits in a busy area near the Oakland Airport. That number includes 1,174 car break-ins. One nearby employee described seeing two people get out of their car and rob the entire drive-thru lane at gunpoint last year. “We feel the frequency and severity of the crimes being encountered by our customers and associates leave us no alternative,” an In-N-Out executive said. Staff / Associated Press 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Wedding ring bearers are typically cute toddlers. Maybe a tiny dog, if you’re feeling creative. But for the price of $1,200 plus travel expenses, one Long Beach-based falconer will deploy a bird of prey to swoop in through your ceremony and deliver the rings. Jonathan Gonzalez, one of several falconers in the U.S. that’ve started offering wedding services, said he does about four or five weddings a year — and all have gone off without a hitch. Clients can choose between Marty the lanner falcon or Ollie and Martin, the Eurasian eagle-owls. “They have never gotten poop on a dress,” Gonzalez said.

Here’s the news you need to know for today. 1. Rep. Karen Bass is leading developer Rick Caruso by 1.6 percentage points in the Los Angeles mayoral race. Only 67.26% of the expected vote has been tallied in the historically expensive election. Lara Korte / Politico 2. Sydney Kamlager, a USC alumna, will represent California’s 37th Congressional District which includes USC and its neighboring communities. Kamlager — a Democrat who’s currently a member of the state senate — will fill Rep. Karen Bass’ seat in the House. Jennifer Nehrer / Daily Trojan 3. Nearly 48,000 University of California academic workers are on strike, protesting alleged unfair labor practices on the part of the UC. The teaching assistants, postdoctoral scholars, student researchers, tutors and fellows are picketing across all 10 UC campuses. Mark Alfred and Holly Rusch / Daily Nexus 4. California could decide control of the House. The state is home to 11 of 19 not-yet-called races that will determine who holds a razor-thin majority in the lower chamber. Republicans are currently ahead in six of those races, and Democrats are ahead in five. Claire Hao and Joe Garofoli / San Francisco Chronicle 5. Sheriff Alex Villanueva’s lasting legacy could be county reform — that he opposes. L.A. voters appear poised to pass Measure A, an amendment to the county’s charter that would give the Board of Supervisors the authority to boot an elected sheriff. A work-in-progress vote count on Thursday showed that 69% of voters supported the proposal, which, if passed, would be largely seen as a repudiation of Villanueva’s troubled tenure. Currently, Villanueva trails former Long Beach Police Chief Robert Luna by 17.6 percentage points in his bid for reelection with 67.2% of expected vote in. Alene Tchekmedyian / Los Angeles Times 6. The California Department of Justice is struggling to meet goals set by a law requiring it to investigate police shootings of unarmed people. The law, which took effect in July 2021, was one of California’s answers to the 2020 police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis — but as of Nov. 10, the department has resolved only one of the state’s 25 opened cases. Nigel Duara / CalMatters 7. Cities across California are attempting to curtail events in rodeos that activists say amount to animal abuse. Rodeo proponents say the push is just another manifestation of radical progressivism that’s seeking to outlaw American culture and tradition. Susanne Rust / Los Angeles Times Nation / world At least six people were killed and 81 injured after a street bombing in Istanbul; Turkey’s vice president called the incident an act of terror, though no group has claimed responsibility yet. ( The Wall Street Journal ) Democrats won control of the Senate after Nevada incumbent Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto was projected to win her race. ( The Washington Post ) President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are expected to meet at the G20 summit in Bali to discuss tensions over Taiwan and Ukraine. ( Reuters ) Voter turnout could decrease in Georgia’s runoff Senate election, partly because early voting cannot begin until state officials have certified the results of the general election. ( Associated Press ) As the culture wars encroach on classrooms, teachers on both sides of the political spectrum have left the profession over mounting pressure from parents and schools. ( NPR ) Sports John McCoy / Associated Press The Trojans put on a show at the Coliseum on Friday, blowing out the University of Colorado 55-17 under the lights. USC redshirt junior holder Will Rose flipped into the endzone on a fake-PAT play, and USC inched up one place on the AP Poll to No. 7. The win did come with a cost, as senior running back Travis Dye is now expected to miss the rest of the season with an injury he suffered in the second quarter. On Saturday, the Trojans will go across town to battle No. 16 UCLA — which suffered an embarrassing loss to the University of Arizona 34-28 over the weekend — at the Rose Bowl. Michael Chow / Annenberg Media Women’s soccer was eliminated in the first round of the NCAA tournament with a 2-0 loss to UC Irvine on Saturday. An Anteater goal in the 16th minute put the Trojans behind for good, and the program ultimately suffered its first ever opening-round exit. USC was 12-1-3 against UCI all-time before Saturday’s defeat. After an embarrassing loss to Florida Gulf Coast University to start the season, men’s basketball rebounded big time with a 96-58 win over Alabama State on Thursday. Senior guard Drew Peterson led the floor with 21 points, also adding 6 assists to his statline. The Trojans will host Vermont on Tuesday at 8 p.m. inside the Galen Center. Women’s hoops stomped Idaho State 75-42 on Saturday . Graduate guard Destiny Littleton drained five 3-pointers before finishing with 19 points on the night. The Trojans go on a road trip this week, beginning with a Tuesday night contest against the University of San Diego. Tomoki Chien / Daily Trojan Men’s water polo was left in shock after its crosstown showdown game against UCLA on Friday. USC led 13-10 in the final minute, but was ultimately defeated 14-13 in overtime. Bruins redshirt sophomore Gianpiero Di Martire converted 3 straight goals in the final minute to send the game to overtime before graduate attacker Jake Cavano scored the game winner.

County. It’s not yet clear if this is a small, early spike, or the beginning of a severe and prolonged flu season. Jonathan Park / Daily Trojan Federal health officials are investigating whether a now-defunct California military base exposed veterans to high levels of cancer-causing toxins. An Associated Press investigation earlier this year found that the Army knew chemicals had been improperly dumped at Fort Ord in Monterey County for decades, but sought to play down the risks.

Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The Trader Joe’s in the Village will close an hour earlier starting Monday, and USC students are up in arms. “Sometimes people only have time to get groceries late at night,” one student said. “Customers are hungry, we all depend on you, I say put in the work,” said another, referring to Trader Joe’s employees. “This pisses me tf off. Do they not understand college students’ schedules??” read a popular social media post . God forbid students have to buy their quirky off-brand snacks by 9 p.m. rather than 10 p.m. Or walk to the Target next door, which still closes at 10 p.m. Or shop while the sun is still out. Anthony Bottino / Annenberg Media 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office called reports that he pushed for an exemption in a fast food wage law that would benefit one of his long-time donors “absurd.” The law exempts businesses who bake and sell bread a la carte from a new $20 minimum wage, which would in theory benefit Newsom donor and billionaire Greg Flynn, who owns two dozen Panera Bread restaurants throughout the state. A spokesperson said the governor never met with Flynn and claimed the exemption actually doesn’t cover Panera because it mixes its dough off site. Experts say the law’s language is up for interpretation. Ashley Zavala / KCRA 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Chevy Camaro thefts are soaring in LA this year, and police might finally know why: Investigators said they caught a 16-year-old using an electronic device capable of cloning ignition keys to steal the muscle cars, who then resold them for a few thousand dollars on social media. It’s unclear how many thefts that particular teen is responsible for, but it’s likely that similar key fob-cloning devices are responsible for the surge in thefts. Such technology is commercially available, and thieves with some technical know-how can generate replacement keys for cars in less than three minutes. Richard Winton / Los Angeles Times 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Officials warned of “life-threatening blizzard conditions” in the Sierra Nevada starting this morning in an alert that’s reserved for only the worst of snow storms. Parts of the region including Lake Tahoe could see up to 3 feet of snow, which, combined with high winds, can make it difficult to see things just a few feet away. Park officials urged people to leave Yosemite “as soon as possible,” and some ski resorts said they’d close for the weekend. Beyond its dangerous conditions, the storm could help recharge the Sierra snowpack, which is currently at 80% of its normal level. The snowpack accounts for about a third of the state’s annual water supply. Judson Jones / The New York Times 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] There’s a mystery in San Francisco. Earlier this year, word spread on social media that a prominent community activist named Richard Parina died. Local politicians eulogized the leader, calling him a “true hero” as condolences poured in for the man who said he was a retired brigadier general with multiple Purple Hearts and a Silver Star. But it turns out the military has no record of Parina ever serving. Also, the high school he said he went to has no record of him graduating. Nor did he live where he said he did, and he may not have been married to the wife he claimed he was. The best part: There’s no record of Parina’s death, either in San Francisco or in Napa County, where an email address claiming to belong to Parina’s widow said he died. “One last thing....die a slow death...please!” the person emailed journalists investigating the story. Annie Gaus and Josh Koehn / The San Francisco Standard p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A correction on a story the other day: In this year’s Undergraduate Student Government elections, only the presidential election used ranked-choice voting — not both that and the senate elections, as we originally wrote. Also, 4,099 students cast ballots in the presidential race, but a total of 4,306 students voted in all races."},{"slug":"unhinged-male-rage-in-newsom-desantis-debate","title":"'Unhinged male rage' in Newsom-DeSantis debate","date":1701447385000,"web_exclusive":false,"content":"*|MC_PREVIEW_TEXT|* View this email in your browser By Tomoki Chien Good morning. It’s Friday, and this is the 200th edition of Morning, Trojan. It’s hard to believe we’ve written so many of these. This is the last newsletter of the calendar year: We’re pausing production now through winter break and will return in January. If you’re looking for a similar newsletter to read in the meantime, I’d highly recommend the California Sun . I believe there’s a one-month free trial for new subscribers, and the format is pretty similar to Morning, Trojan — you just won’t get the USC-specific angle. Stay tuned for an email later today with some big updates to Morning, Trojan. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Gov. Gavin Newsom and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis largely resorted to name calling and accusing each other of lying in Thursday night’s debate on Fox. The two discussed little of substantive policy but did throw some zingers: At one point, Newsom quipped that “neither of us will be our party’s nominee in 2024.” The only winner of the night might’ve been “unhinged male rage,” Emily Hoeven wrote in the San Francisco Chronicle. Emily Hoeven / San Francisco Chronicle 2. Millions of people in Northern and Central California will see their utility bills soar by as much as $600 next year, thanks to a Pacific Gas &amp; Electric rate hike approved by a state commission. There’s no cap to what PG&amp;E and other utility giants can seek in rate increases: The only regulating body is the Public Utility Commission, which, for its part, said it “substantially” cut PG&amp;E’s initial request for additional revenue from $15.4 billion to $13.5 billion. PG&amp;E’s rates have consistently outpaced inflation, rising 51% over the last three years compared to an only 18% increase in consumer prices over the same time period. Mark Kreidler / Capital &amp; Main 3. Multiple Republican lawmakers expect former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to leave Congress before the end of the year. The Bakersfield Republican’s potential exit could narrow the GOP’s already razor-thin majority in the House and present a problem for party leadership until a special election could be held. “I mean, why the hell would he stay?” one lawmaker said, referring to McCarthy’s bitter ouster from the speakership. Juliegrace Brufke / Axios 4. Hate crimes in LA County soared to their highest levels in two decades last year, a county report found. The annual report, which covered the 2022 calendar year — before the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war — found that anti-Jewish hate crimes spiked by 59% and anti-Black crimes rose by 34%. Nearly three-quarters of the crimes were violent. Rebecca Ellis / Los Angeles Times 5. Solano County residents were quick to heckle a project looking to build a new city from scratch on the rural outskirts of the San Francisco Bay Area in a town hall meeting. The crowd of around 100 at the event featuring Jan Sramek, chief executive of the private company responsible for the proposed project, seemed largely skeptical of anything the executive had to say. “If not here, where?” Sramek said, touting the project’s plans to build middle-class homes. “Not here!” an audience member shouted back.

That figure — based on GoFundMe listings, social media, and interviews — is likely to grow substantially. The school hasn’t released an official tally. Tomoki Chien and Yana Savitsky / Morning, Trojan 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Officials warned that strong winds could fuel further “explosive fire growth” Monday evening through Wednesday. As of 5 a.m. today, the Palisades fire was 13% contained, and the Eaton fire was 27%. The death toll has risen to 24 . Staff / Los Angeles Times 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Police shot a man brandishing a knife outside an apartment complex just a few blocks north of campus Saturday. A witness who saw the incident at Oak and 23rd streets said cops told the man to drop his knife, then shot nonlethal rounds at him — and resorted to firearms when he still held the weapon.

Tomo Chien August 16, 2025 p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC will sunset two tuition benefits that allow qualified undergraduates to enroll in extra courses for free, according to a memo obtained by Morning, Trojan.

Tomo Chien May 09, 2025 When contacted for this story, USC suggested that it’ll resume hiring at the department. (Jason Goode) p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC could lose significant federal funding if a severe “staffing crisis” in its animal research program isn’t addressed soon, according to a scathing internal memo circulated last week. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The warning — issued by the department that handles lab animals used in university research and teaching — outlined several stopgap measures meant to cope with a staff shortage that it blamed on USC’s ongoing hiring freeze . p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Those measures include delaying the purchase of new animals, cleaning facilities less often, and suspending the sterilization of animal racks, which the memo described as a “key biosafety measure.” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “This is all to prevent serious research disruptions,” wrote Ari Aycock-Williams, director of the Department of Animal Resources, in the memo. “If attrition continues, this crisis will quickly escalate to unobserved animals, animal welfare noncompliance, research project delays, loss of accreditation, loss of all federal funding, and reputational damage that far outweigh any perceived savings.” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The memo was referring to the accreditation that allows USC to perform research on animals. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] When asked for comment on this story a week after the memo first circulated, a USC spokesperson suggested that the school will resume hiring for the “highest university priorities,” including at the Department of Animal Resources. The blanket freeze on other staff hiring will remain in place. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Aycock-Williams did not respond to multiple requests for comment. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] This is not the first of USC’s animal research troubles. In April, Stop Animal Exploitation Now , a national watchdog group, asked federal officials to revoke the school’s funding for lab research on animals, citing several violations of animal welfare laws. The same group called for USC to face fines months prior when federal inspectors found that researchers grossly abused three rabbits in an experiment. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The animal department’s staffing woes are the latest symptom of a budget crisis that has seen USC mandate sweeping spending cuts , including March’s hiring freeze, in an attempt to curtail its operating deficit. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC has blamed inflation, rising insurance costs, lackluster graduate student enrollment, increases in financial aid, and “the rising cost of college athletics” — among other things — for its deficit, which preceded the second Trump administration. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “All commitments to federal animal care guidelines will continue to be honored,” a USC spokesperson wrote. “The emergency measures described by our Department of Animal Resources are intended to help ensure that USC continues to meet or exceed these federal guidelines.” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Still, the memo raised alarm bells among animal welfare activists. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “This document does nothing but increase our concerns,” said Michael Budkie, executive director of Stop Animal Exploitation Now. “They weren’t complying with federal regulations when they had full staff. So what are we going to see now?” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Last week’s memo noted that the Department of Animal Resources is suffering a 17% staff deficit and employs just one clinical vet for all of USC’s campuses. U.S. Department of Agriculture documents show that as of 2023, USC housed at least 356 animals, including four dogs, 46 pigs, and 87 rabbits. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “Practically everything that’s discussed in here points to at least the potential for more violations,” Budkie said. “A 17% staff deficit — that’s significant.” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Tomo Chien can be reached at tomo@morningtrojan.com ."},{"slug":"usc-apartment-meal-plan-increase","title":"USC jacks apartment meal plan by $2,280 annually","date":1739165297000,"web_exclusive":true,"content":".bh__byline_wrapper .bh__byline_social_wrapper .bh__byline_social_wrapper > * + * @media (min-width: 768px) .bh__byline_social_wrapper } USC jacks apartment meal plan by $2,280 annually Tomo Chien & Colin Stillman February 09, 2025 The new package offers 120 meal swipes per semester rather than 40. (Tomoki Chien) p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC jacked the price of its mandatory apartment meal plan to $1,975 per semester, forcing students to eat a substantial price hike in exchange for more meal swipes and menu options. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The base plan previously cost $835. All sophomores, juniors, and seniors living in USC Housing apartments must enroll in the plan, whose price increase goes into effect in the fall. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The new “ Flex120 ” package includes 120 dining hall swipes per semester instead of 40, and students can use those credits in “most” Ronald Tutor Campus Center eateries, according to the university’s website . Previously, the apartment meal plan only offered swipes in USC’s three dining halls. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Like the old apartment meal plan, the Flex120 plan offers $150 dining dollars which can be used at restaurants and cafes around campus. Leftover swipes and dollars do not roll over to the next semester. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Each dining hall swipe now effectively costs $15 rather than $17, though that may come as little solace to students forced to cough up an additional $2,280 annually to live in USC apartments. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The university has traditionally increased the cost of its meal plans by modest amounts year-over-year. Last year, the cost of the mandatory apartment meal plan increased by $40. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Anna Hsu contributed reporting to this story."},{"slug":"usc-appoints-new-athletic-director","title":"USC appoints new athletic director","date":1692716376000,"web_exclusive":false,"content":"*|MC_PREVIEW_TEXT|* View this email in your browser By Tomoki Chien Good morning, I hope you had a good start to the semester.

San Bernardino County deputies killed Ikeguchi in a shootout after he fled on foot. Sam Levin / The Guardian 4. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco filed for bankruptcy Monday, saying the move was necessary to “manage and resolve” more than 500 sexual abuse lawsuits.

Who&#39;s next? Tomo Chien February 26, 2024 p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A potentially landmark hearing resumes today, where federal labor officials will determine whether some USC athletes are employees of the university, the Pac-12 and NCAA. A ruling in favor of employee status could turn the tide on the NCAA’s long-standing insistence that its players are amateur “student-athletes” — but don’t get too excited yet. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Any lasting decision that’ll apply to college athletes across the country will likely have to come from the Supreme Court, and that process could take years. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Today, I’m diving into the latest seismic shift in the world of collegiate athletics. A judge could rule that football and basketball athletes at USC are employees under federal labor law. (Tomoki Chien / Annenberg Media) It’ll get messy p span[style*=\"font-size\"] In the case against USC, the National Labor Relations Board is alleging that the university, Pac-12 and NCAA are unlawfully classifying athletes on the football and basketball teams as amateurs. One of the labor board’s own administrative law judges is presiding over the hearing. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The question isn’t really how the judge will rule — a decision in favor of employee status seems likely — but rather, how long the appeals process will take, and how long it’ll for take this case or a similar one to wind up in front of the Supreme Court. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Whichever party loses is sure to initiate a lengthy appeal, so the judge’s ruling won’t be the end of this. And for the case to have serious implications beyond just USC, it’ll need to make it much farther up the food chain. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] That’s because the labor board only deals with specific instances. For example, when the board ruled earlier this month that men’s basketball athletes at Dartmouth College are union-eligible employees, it didn’t affect any other athletes at Dartmouth — and it certainly didn’t mean that Harvard or Yale basketball players were awarded the same status. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Just because the board decides that one set of athletes are professionals doesn’t mean that all others are too. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Of course, the case at USC has potentially larger implications than at Dartmouth because the NCAA and a major athletic conference are also included in the charges. But a ruling in favor of employee status is sure to raise more questions than answers. Here’s one: The labor board only oversees the private sector. USC and the NCAA are both private organizations. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] But what about UCLA? Those athletes play for a public university whose workers must seek labor arbitration with the separate California Public Employment Relations Board. But those athletes still play in the private NCAA. So are they part of the public or private sector? Who gets jurisdiction over them? p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Also, certainly not all collegiate athletes meet the definition of an employee under federal labor law; the golf team, while still subject to a rigorous schedule, likely practices fewer hours and rakes in drastically less revenue than the football team. But what’s the threshold? At what point do student-athletes become professionals? p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “There’s going to be no finality until there’s acceptance across all the courts because of a Supreme Court ruling, or alternatively because Congress actually gets involved or even the states get involved,” said Joseph Paller, a labor attorney. “I just don’t anticipate Congress doing anything.” It’ll get messier p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The road to the Supreme Court will be a long one. As already established, separate labor board rulings could lead to a confusing patchwork of rules across different schools and athletic conferences. But it gets worse than that. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The labor board is a creature of politics, and a shift in the White House this election cycle could lead to appointees who are more hostile toward unions and collective bargaining. And even once those cases make it to the judicial system, the 13 circuit courts all have different track records in labor rulings. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] So even if the 5th Circuit, which is historically skeptical of labor unions, strikes down one of the labor board’s rulings, the board could continue to litigate its position in all the other circuits — like the historically union-friendly 9th Circuit. That’s a patchwork on top of a patchwork. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] And even ahead of any major judicial ruling, some universities will no doubt look to alter practice and competition regimes to protect the amateur status of their athletes. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “We’re moving into a brave new world where issues that the courts and agencies have turned a blind eye to for decades are finally getting the kind of scrutiny that they deserve,” Paller said. “The economic reality is that students are engaged in profit-making activities, and every aspect of every hour that they spend as an athlete is regulated by the university. That is, I would say, employment.” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] What widespread employee status across the NCAA would actually mean is a bit of an open question. Athletes would make at least a minimum wage and in most cases be able to unionize and bargain over working conditions, but it’s hard to predict how that would play into the already seismic conference realignment and name, image and likeness deals. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Already, though, the NCAA of today is not the institution of your parents’ generation. And in a decade, even you might not recognize it anymore. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Support this newsletter"},{"slug":"usc-austerity-measures-budget-reductions-hiring-freeze","title":"We translated USC's budget reductions","date":1742914560000,"web_exclusive":false,"content":".bh__byline_wrapper .bh__byline_social_wrapper .bh__byline_social_wrapper > * + * @media (min-width: 768px) .bh__byline_social_wrapper } We translated USC&#39;s budget reductions Tomo Chien March 25, 2025 p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Good morning.

Moody’s, a credit rating agency, reported in March that the school expects “modest improvement” in fiscal year 2025 “with more substantive improvement” the following year — in large part thanks to budget cuts. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Do you have insider information?

Tomo Chien May 21, 2025 Folt retires next month. (Tomo Chien) p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC President Carol Folt raked in nearly $5 million last school year, new federal tax documents show. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Folt’s $350,000 pay bump from 2023 — more than twice the median USC professor’s salary — will likely keep her in the running for the country’s highest-paid university president. The embattled administrator will retire next month. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] p span[style*=\"font-size\"] p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The tax filings, shared this week by a university spokesperson, are a year old. Nonprofits like USC aren’t required to file the disclosures until 12 months after a given fiscal year. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Still, the Internal Revenue Service documents offer one of the best windows into the private university’s otherwise opaque finances. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Notably, while Folt’s compensation reached an all-time high in the latest disclosure, executive pay on the whole declined after a steep rebound from COVID-era administrative pay cuts. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] p span[style*=\"font-size\"] p span[style*=\"font-size\"] As per usual, the school’s highest paid employees largely hail from the Keck School of Medicine. Those include doctors Louis Vandermolen ($4 million) and Vaughn Starnes ($3.9 million), as well as dean Carolyn Meltzer ($1.7 million) and executives Steven Shapiro ($3.3 million) and Rod Hanners ($2.3 million). p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Rounding out the top 10 non-athletics list were former HR-head Felicia Washington ($1.5 million), Chief Financial Officer Erik Brink ($1.5 million), Chief Investment Officer Amy Diamond ($2 million), and General Counsel Beong-Soo Kim ($1.5 million), who will serve as the school’s interim president when Folt retires. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Football coach Lincoln Riley ($11.5 million), former basketball coach Andy Enfield ($4.7 million), and Director of Athletics Jennifer Cohen ($3.1 million), dwarfed the compensation of their academic counterparts, as is typical. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Several other findings: USC continued its venerable tradition of forking over millions to consultants ($18.6 million to Deloitte). Folt received “house management services” for her posh Santa Monica home . As of a year ago, Riley owed the university $3.4 million on a housing loan.

Tomo Chien August 13, 2025 USC’s budget crisis has threatened to lay off hundreds of employees. (Chris Bibona) p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The tidy, modern villas of Adelaide Place belong to an exclusive caste of Santa Monica society. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Homeowners on this tony cul-de-sac include legendary director Oliver Stone’s wife, a Pakistani textile scion, and a heavyweight private equity executive. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] It is also home to the University of Southern California’s presidential property, a sleek, $9 million, modernist compound complete with a pool, gym, and ocean view. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Seven months ago, it received an upgrade. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Months into its worst budget crisis in recent memory, USC, no stranger to tone-deaf gaffes, spent $50,000 renovating the Santa Monica home. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Upgrades included a motorized, waist-high vehicle gate, a driveway callbox, and a parcel box, according to permitting records reviewed by Morning, Trojan. USC applied for the permit on Sept. 11 and city officials were scheduled to visit the property for their final inspection on Jan. 30. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The school purchased the home in 2020 to be occupied by former President Carol Folt, who in the 2024 fiscal year earned nearly $5 million. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The renovations, modest by the standards of Los Angeles luxury but striking in their timing, landed in the middle of a budget crisis that has slashed student programs, laid off scores of employees, and threatened to cull hundreds more. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A USC spokesperson did not respond to a detailed list of questions about the renovations. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “We’re following best practices in providing security around a university president’s home,” the spokesperson wrote of the gate that offers an unobstructed view of the property. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] In response to a question about whether USC plans to sell the home, the spokesperson said the school is preparing it for sale — a fact that has not been reported until now. Later, by phone, the spokesperson said the gate would add value to the home ahead of its listing. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Folt did not respond to requests for comment. Construction coincided with budget crisis p span[style*=\"font-size\"] By the time USC representatives filed for the property’s construction permit in September, the school’s budget crisis had already crept into public view. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The university ordered at least two layoffs in the months preceding the permit application, and as the academic year began, asked schools and administrative units to reduce their budgets. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The signs would only grow more alarming as construction started at the president’s property. In November, Provost Andrew Guzman announced that USC racked up a $158 million operating deficit the prior fiscal year. The school proceeded to ax scholarships , funding for student organizations , and popular employee benefits before the end of the calendar year. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Then there is the fact that USC’s fiscal year ends on June 30, suggesting that executives were likely aware of the deficit by that time in 2024. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Indeed, this July — well ahead of the school’s typical November release of its audited financial statements — Interim President Beong-Soo Kim announced that USC faced a deficit of over $200 million. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “Left untamed, this recurring, structural deficit erodes cash reserves, constrains future planning and capital needs, and is simply unsustainable,” Kim wrote . Life on Adelaide Place p span[style*=\"font-size\"] On a recent visit to Adelaide Place in Santa Monica’s North of Montana neighborhood, Morning, Trojan found an idyllic cul-de-sac, hushed except for the occasional purr of a Mercedes Benz, or the whir of a Tesla Model S. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] This is the kind of street where neighbors regularly appear on donor lists at local charities and boast profiles in Bloomberg’s web directory. In 2019, the neighborhood unleashed a minor media crusade when the owners of the cul-de-sac’s historic “Zuni House” turned the property into an Airbnb rental.

The university notified city officials that it was changing its contractor for the work in November. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A USC spokesperson did not answer questions about whether Folt, who left her post in July, has vacated the property. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] In April, Folt and her husband purchased a $2.7 million corner-unit penthouse on the top floor of a luxury Santa Monica high rise, property records show. It is unclear whether USC plans to purchase a new president’s home after selling the current property. End of an era p span[style*=\"font-size\"] It was March 2020, and the purchase of the Santa Monica home signaled a restart. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] For decades, the school’s leaders had lived in a palatial, 14,000-square-foot San Marino manor, which a listing would later boast was one of the largest private estates in the Greater LA area, at seven acres. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] This was not for Folt. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The biologist, who most recently served as chancellor of the University of North Carolina, promised to make environmental sustainability a focus of her tenure. Accordingly, USC had rented the apparently eco-friendly Santa Monica home on her behalf, and now felt it was time to purchase the property. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] It bought the four-bed, five-bath Ray Kappe-designed home for $8.6 million, and would later sell the San Marino estate for $25 million. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Folt’s decision to eschew the San Marino property signaled a break from the old guard: one that had presided over a series of recent high-profile scandals including a dean who hosted drug-fueled parties, a university gynecologist accused of sexually abusing hundreds of patients, and a sprawling, illegal college admissions scheme . p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “The times have changed how university presidents operate,” Rick Caruso, then chairman of the board of trustees, told the LA Times . “We also have a very contemporary president who lives a very different lifestyle, and I felt, the board felt, that the home has to be such that it is a place where Carol is happy.” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Chris Bibona contributed reporting. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Tomo Chien can be reached at tomo@morningtrojan.com ."},{"slug":"usc-carol-folt-stepping-down","title":"Carol Folt finally steps down.

Her resignation is effective July 2025. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Students immediately took to social media to celebrate the news. “Ding dong the witch is dead,” one commented on an Annenberg Media Instagram post . “BYE PUMPKIN!!!” commented another. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “You guys bullied this woman so much she decided she had enough,” somebody posted on SideChat . p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “Please choose Michelle Obama,” wrote another.

In 2021, lawmakers passed a bill that allowed a state commission to strip officers of their right to work on a police force — an effort to prevent them from evading punishment by simply transferring to another department. But departments are refusing to share why officers are being decertified thanks to a temporary exemption granted by Gov. Gavin Newsom, removing a key component of accountability.

Tomo Chien December 23, 2024 This school hasn’t formally announced the cut. (Courtesy Gina Nguyen) p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC will dramatically reduce a merit scholarship it offers for students who earned elite scores on their high school PSAT exams. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Those students, known as National Merit Finalists, have historically enjoyed half-tuition scholarships — $34,952 this year, according to financial aid documents viewed by Morning, Trojan. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] That number is now $20,000. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Students who currently receive the scholarship will not be affected by the roughly 43% reduction, a university spokesperson said. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Still, the cuts will no doubt factor into the college decisions of some of the nation’s highest-performing high school students as the peak of the admissions season approaches. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “The university is diverting more financial support to incoming students with demonstrated need,” the university wrote in a statement. “The new award amount, $20,000 per year, remains one of the largest financial stipends offered to National Merit Finalists by our peers in higher education.” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC is yet to formally announce the cut. The only reference to the reduction is a document on the school’s undergraduate admissions page, dated December 19, that lists the new value. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The award has historically fluctuated yearly for existing students, financial aid documents show. However, those past fluctuations have represented increases to ensure the scholarship continued to cover half of the school’s rising tuition. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] 135 students in this year’s freshman class received the scholarship. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The decrease is the latest in a recent torrent of cost-slashing measures as the school seeks to avoid falling into yet another $158 million budget deficit . p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Notably, in October, the school reduced a key benefit that paid tuition for the children of faculty and staff, then partially walked back its decision just a week later. USC also recently ordered its first permanent layoffs in over a decade, and has pulled funding from student newsrooms like the Daily Trojan and Annenberg Media. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Such cost slashing appears unlikely to end. The provost warned in November that the school should expect “difficult decisions” as central administration looks to balance its books. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The scholarship reduction also comes as the university continues to jack tuition at a rate that far outpaces national inflation. USC is the most expensive college in the United States. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] This is not the first recent scholarship on the chopping block. Last semester, the school axed two awards that let eligible students enroll in extra courses for free. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] It later partially walked back the cut, after which USC President Carol Folt told Annenberg Media that she “sat down and took a breath” before recognizing that the award was “one of the more important programs.” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] That “breath” was likely encouraged by a 3,100-signature petition, indignation from the student government, and a litany of nasty Instagram comments . p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Colin Stillman contributed reporting to this story. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] RELATED: What people get wrong about USC’s endowment.

USC fell four spots in the U.S. News and World Report’s 2024 rankings, from 24 to 28. The drop could likely be attributed to a significant change in the formula which excludes five factors including class size and high school class standing, and instead focuses on whether students from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds succeed on campus and whether students graduate with “manageable debt.” USC is now tied with UC Davis, UC San Diego and the University of Florida. Staff / Annenberg Media 2. A California water district is considering building offshore desalination plants to harvest drinking water from the ocean. A third-party company partnering with the Las Virgenes Municipal Water District claims that the underwater desalination pods would dramatically lower energy costs — because they can utilize the pressure at the bottom of the ocean floor — and reduce the output of harmful salty brine when compared to traditional land-based plants. Hayley Smith / Los Angeles Times 3. The man arrested in the ambush killing of an LA County deputy over the weekend was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, his mother told authorities. Kevin Cataneo Salazar, 29, was detained after an hourslong confrontation with a SWAT team at his parents’ home just a few miles from where he shot Deputy Ryan Clinkunbroomer. Sheriff Robert Luna said he was “extremely confident that we have the right person in custody.” Adeel Hassan / The New York Times 4. A sexual harassment lawsuit against California Treasurer Fiona Ma by a former high-ranking employee will go to trial after a judge denied a motion to dismiss it. Judith Blackwell, former head of the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee, said Ma would often call her into hotel rooms and expose her nude backside and at least once climbed into Blackwell’s bed with her. Ma said the incidents were not sexual in nature. Staff / Associated Press 5. Climate change has spelled the beginning of the end for California’s $200 million commercial fishing industry. Years of drought have strained the salmon population, prompting authorities to close the salmon season for the first time since 2009. Warming oceans have for years pushed whales closer to shore, entangling them with fishing gear and delaying crab seasons.

(Tomo Chien) p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The email was startling. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “Dear Trojan students, I am pleased to announce that Rick Caruso has been selected the next USC President,” read an official-looking announcement that hit student inboxes late Tuesday night. “His confidence and faith in USC are inspiring, and his optimism is infectious.” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC, it seemed, had dropped a bombshell announcement, abruptly ending its search for a new president and elevating the billionaire real estate mogul to the role. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Signed … Levi? p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “April Fools’!” senior Levi Elias said in an interview at 10:30 p.m. Tuesday, exulting after firing off his last batch of emails. “I’d like to think I got some people.” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The prank was massive in scale, reaching over 52,000 student inboxes. But this was not a high-tech operation, the screenwriting major said. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] It started when he and senior Josh Wolk managed to acquire the behemoth list of student emails. (This year’s student body is around 47,000 strong, so the list likely includes some former students.) p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The two declined to share how they found the list, lest bad actors abuse the system in the future. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Originally, they planned to exchange mundane meeting notes from The Sack of Troy — the campus satire paper that Elias writes for — and “accidentally” CC the entire student body. The paper’s staff would then start a “reply all” thread of wholly boring content. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Except, Elias’s laptop crashed when he tried to compose the huge email. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “He thought all hope was lost,” said Wolk, who’s a business major. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] But hours later, the two discovered they could use Brightspace, USC’s learning management platform, to send mass emails. The dream was alive once more, and this time in the form of a fake presidential announcement. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Elias and Wolk floated several candidates they could name, including Arnold Schwarzenegger. Eventually, they landed on Caruso: It needed to be somewhat believable, Elias said, and also relatively innocuous. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “I’m not trying to get expelled,” he said. The two worked over FaceTime as they prepared the prank. (Josh Wolk) p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Over five hours, the two students manually added semicolon separators between all the email addresses so the announcement would send properly. And because Brightspace puts a 1,000-person cap on its emails, they had to send the announcement in 53 rounds. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “I’m not the brightest man,” Elias said. “But what I do have is determination. And a fair amount of time.” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] It is not entirely clear if the prank violated USC policy. Perhaps the most applicable line of the university’s acceptable use policy reads: “Shortcuts bypassing system’s security measures, as well as pranks and practical jokes involving the compromise of security measures, are prohibited.” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A university spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Asked if they had any message for USC students, the two pranksters hedged. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “I’m really busy,” Elias said. “I don’t know why I did this. I’ve got a lot of stuff going on. It was the dumbest thing of all time.” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Then, he hung up the phone, and started sifting through the torrent of emails in his inbox. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Update: KTLA fell for the prank in an early Wednesday morning segment.

Tomo Chien September 02, 2024 Institutional neutrality directs universities not to comment on political, social, or moral issues. (Courtesy Gina Nguyen / Daily Trojan) p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC just enacted a significant new policy that has flown largely under the radar. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] It’s a policy of “institutional neutrality,” buried nine paragraphs down in a recent university email , that says USC and its leaders won’t take a public stance on any political, moral, or social issue unless it pertains directly to the school. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] This is notable. Institutional neutrality is a key tenet at schools like the University of Chicago, whose policies are generally regarded as the standard for protecting student free speech. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “The instrument of dissent and criticism is the individual faculty member or the individual student,” wrote University of Chicago legal scholar Harry Kalven Jr. in 1967. “The university is the home and sponsor of critics; it is not itself the critic.” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The argument for institutional neutrality goes something like this: A university’s most important duty is to protect its students’ and faculty’s ability to exchange ideas freely. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] By taking a stance on a controversial issue, the university is bound to stifle debate — so it shouldn’t. But the key is that the school then can’t take a stance on any issue. USC President Carol Folt was widely criticized for her handling of last year’s pro-Palestinian protests. (Tomoki Chien / Daily Trojan) p span[style*=\"font-size\"] For instance, imagine Congress passes bipartisan, wholly uncontroversial climate protections, and USC President Carol Folt makes an Instagram post celebrating the legislation. Innocuous enough. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] But then on Oct. 7, Hamas launches a bloody terror attack on Israel, igniting a war that will go on to kill tens of thousands of Palestinians. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Folt could choose not to make a statement. Supporters of institutional neutrality would argue she could inadvertently stifle university discourse — and is at the very least going to take flak for whatever she says. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Except, she already set the precedent that she’s willing to comment on social and political issues. If she could comment on the climate, why can’t she take a stance on Israel and Palestine? p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Her silence would say almost as much as an actual statement. So instead, she and her advisors have to wordsmith a flaccid statement that they hope won’t piss everybody off. And then another one , when it does. Los Angeles police arrested 48 students in last semester’s protests. (Tomoki Chien / Morning, Trojan) p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The reality is that, no matter what activists on both sides say, the president of a posh Los Angeles university’s stance on Middle East relations is likely not going to stop Israel from dropping behemoth Mark 84 munitions on Gaza, nor is it going to persuade Hamas to renounce its founding goal of killing Jews . p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A supporter of institutional neutrality might say there are better things Folt could do with her time, namely ensuring that academic operations continue functioning as usual — and that students are free to civilly debate and exchange ideas. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The policy does have its critics. Detractors have called it “ institutional deception ” and a “ dishrag for cleaning up the occasional spill .” They tend to argue that it’s impossible for a university to be neutral, and that such a policy is only a piece of paper for administrators to hide behind. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] And at USC specifically, students on both sides have implored the university to publicly support their views. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] It’s not clear how this new policy will play with the rest of the university’s free speech protections or its handling of the Israel-Palestine fallout, where it has consistently displayed an ineptitude for crisis management — and general common sense. Los Angeles police roughed up student protesters while clearing the first encampment last semester. (Tomoki Chien / Morning, Trojan) p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC evidently did not want a controversial graduation speaker . So why did it choose one? And once the provost’s office did choose the speaker, who thought that cutting the speech would help avoid controversy? p span[style*=\"font-size\"] When students first erected an encampment, the school cleared it, then waffled when it came right back. Folt largely hid behind her relatively unknown senior administration officials, and the few public statements she did make only antagonized protestors . p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The pinnacle of it all was probably the “ designated free speech area ” that was very likely inspired by an episode of Arrested Development . p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Will institutional neutrality merely let Folt duck for cover when the next big controversy inevitably rises? Or does it signal the start of a maturing USC administration that is committed to protecting free speech? It’s hard to tell right now. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] But while Folt is undoubtedly responsible for USC’s bungled response to last semester’s tumult, you can cut her some slack. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC does not have the muscle memory to address contentious student demonstrations that a school like, say, UC Berkeley does. This is not a campus with a particularly strong history of activism; it’s the University of Spoiled Children. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] But over the last few decades, university leadership has slowly and deliberately molded USC into an elite institution that is increasingly approaching the ranks of schools like UC Berkeley and Stanford. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] That brings its own set of challenges, and USC had better get used to it. Institutional neutrality could be a step in the right direction."},{"slug":"usc-faculty-union-cards","title":"Faculty look to unionize","date":1733500635000,"web_exclusive":false,"content":".bh__byline_wrapper .bh__byline_social_wrapper .bh__byline_social_wrapper > * + * @media (min-width: 768px) .bh__byline_social_wrapper } Faculty look to unionize Tomo Chien December 06, 2024 p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Good morning.

Why are staff and faculty shouldering the burden? “Austerity for thee, not for me” has been our administration’s policy throughout this crisis. Howard Rodman, Christina Dunbar-Hester, and Laura Isabel Serna April 29, 2025 We propose that the university’s top earners commit to pay cuts. (Photo: Tomo Chien) p span[style*=\"font-size\"] This is a guest column. All three authors are tenured professors at USC. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Five months ago, USC announced something that a series of sweeping budget cuts had already signaled: It was facing a structural deficit of $158 million, and more pain would be coming. As Provost Andrew Guzman then told the faculty senate, “Difficult decisions are going to have to be made.” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Matters have since gotten worse. USC now faces cuts to federal research funding and potential decreases in international student enrollment due to the Trump administration’s policies. Leadership has responded to this perfect storm of budget pressure by freezing faculty and staff wages, halting hiring, and suspending many investments in student learning, including the purchase of certain library books and all new database and journal subscriptions. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] It will undoubtedly take shared sacrifice to weather the next four years of this administration. But at USC, it seems that sacrifice is coming from the bottom up. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] This year, with a few limited exceptions, no USC employees will receive a merit raise . The so-called austerity measure was introduced alongside notable cuts to employee benefits and increases in out-of-pocket healthcare costs . Meanwhile, USC’s administrators, many of whom earn seven-figure salaries, have not committed to eschewing their own contractually-defined pay raises. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] IRS data shows that in the 2022-2023 academic year (the most recent year available), 18 USC executives made over $1 million. This includes $3 million paid to former President Max Nikias, along with the over $3.5 million base salary paid to our current president — not including housing and other perks. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] We propose that the university’s top earners commit to freezing their wages and taking pay cuts. This will ensure that USC does not balance its budget on the backs of our most vulnerable staff and faculty. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] There is precedent for this. In 2020, at the onset of the pandemic, the president took a 20% reduction in salary , and the provost, senior vice presidents, and deans reduced their salaries by 10%, while reinstating pay increases for employees making less than $100,000 per year. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] But in 2025, when presented with this idea at faculty senate meetings and via email, the administration has variously dodged the question, admitted that there has been no discussion about the option, or stated that they’ve already detailed their plans to address “financial resiliency.” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “As things continue to evolve at the federal and local level, we will regularly assess how we are progressing and whether further actions or adjustments are needed,” a university spokesperson wrote when asked for comment on this column. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC’s plan to equally cut salaries and benefits across the university — excluding unionized and contractually obligated employees — is regressive by its very nature, and will fall much harder on lower-paid workers. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] University administrators are responsible for shouldering this burden, not just because they are paid more than anybody else, but because they are charged with stewardship of the school and its financial health. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] We are told that administrators’ salaries are justified because of their responsibilities. But by that logic, if the institution is on the financial rocks — which we know was the case even before the election — that is on some level their doing: their failure to plan or anticipate. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Cuts for the rest of us in this context are especially unacceptable.

USC football suspended an Orange County Register reporter’s team access for two weeks — and the media is up in arms. The team contends that the reporter, Luca Evans, violated policy by quoting a conversation he overheard at practice; asking a question after a press conference concluded; and talking to sources in areas of campus not designated for interviews. Critics say those are all minor and fairly common violations, and that the real flash point was likely an article Evans wrote that head coach Lincoln Riley, a known media skeptic, didn’t like.

Embattled LA Councilmember Kevin De León said he plans to run for reelection almost a year after being caught making racist and homophobic remarks in the City Hall leaked audio scandal.

De León will face more than 10 competitors in his bid for reelection. Frank Stoltze / LAist 4. A former longtime USC employee sued the university for wrongful termination. Stephen McElroy, a former facilities manager on Catalina Island, alleged that ageism and violation of labor laws played a role in his 2021 termination.

He was released on $30,000 bail that evening. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A residential advisor at the Parkside International Residential College reported on April 14 that a student pulled a gun on another student, said DPS Assistant Chief David Carlisle. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The resident was arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, Carlisle said, adding that the Los Angeles Police Department recovered a hand gun from a safe in his dorm, as well as a loaded magazine in his car. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] DPS logs show that the alleged incident occurred on the afternoon of April 11, more than three days prior to Khmous’ arrest.

Share this with a friend 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A recent USC grad built a hilarious “brainrot” study tool. It’s pretty simple: Enter PDF notes into Memenome’s website . The AI tool then spits out a narrated video laden with internet slang that summarizes your notes — which are, of course, superimposed on Subway Surfers or Minecraft gameplay. The viral demos are absolutely unhinged. John Millsap / Daily Trojan 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Billionaire Rick Caruso is positioning himself as a major player in the effort to rebuild Pacific Palisades, forming a nonprofit to shepherd recovery efforts. The move puts the mall magnate — and prominent USC trustee — on a crash course with city officials. Caruso opposes building new dense, affordable housing; the city has not ruled it out. Kevin T. Dugan and Peter Grant / The Wall Street Journal 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] LA County officials delayed dozens of water infrastructure upgrades proposed over the last decade that experts say could’ve helped battle the Palisades fire. Residents are irate. But the county’s public works chief in part blamed residents’ anti-development efforts and unwillingness to increase water rates for the delays. Connor Sheets / Los Angeles Times 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] In yet another LA environmental disaster, Rancho Palos Verdes has spent $33 million since July shoring up a massive, slow-motion landslide that’s sending homes into the ocean . That figure is almost as much as it takes to run the rest of the city for an entire year. Yusra Farzan / LAist 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Suspected cartel bandits robbed and shot two hikers near the U.S.-Mexico border in San Diego, Border Patrol officials said.

For a few hours on Sunday morning, the 110 Freeway was closed to cars — and open to bikers and pedestrians. See the Los Angeles Times’ photos of the event here . Onto the five USC, LA and California stories you need to know for today. 1. An overwhelming majority of USC’s graduate student workers voted to authorize a strike Friday, calling for “fair wages” and “real recourse” from USC. A strike isn’t a sure thing: The authorization only gives union leadership the power to call one should contract negotiations fall through. The union represents teaching assistants, research assistants and assistant lecturers from nearly every academic department. “USC administration now knows that the clock is ticking,” the union wrote on Instagram. “It’s time for them to come to the table with serious proposals.” Ye Ji Jong and Yana Savitsky / Annenberg Media 2. LA authorities imposed parking restrictions on streets they say need to be clear for first responders and potential evacuations as strong Santa Ana winds threaten fires across Southern California. The winds — which develop in high pressure areas in Utah and Nevada and eventually blow into California as strong, hot gusts — often fan fires and help them spread much faster than they would normally. The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning for LA and Ventura counties through at least Monday. Mackenzie Mays / Los Angeles Times 3. Just 40% of California high schools offer computer science classes, putting the state at the bottom of a recent report that ranked states by percentage of schools offering computer science instruction. It’s a perhaps surprising metric for the home of Silicon Valley, but educators blamed a shortage of qualified teachers — and administrators who prioritize the subject — for the lackluster offerings. The lack of access disproportionately affects California’s low-income students, rural students and students of color. Carolyn Jones / CalMatters 4. John Muir once wrote that the bighorn sheep “ranks highest among the animal mountaineers of the Sierra.” But 129 years later — as the now-endangered species’s population has dwindled to the low triple digits — half the sheep tracked by scientists died in last winter’s heavy snowfall. Some died in avalanches. Others of starvation. And even more were killed by mountain lions when they were forced to descend to lower elevations to look for food. Scientists say a lack of generational knowledge in herds and their already low numbers are to blame for the die-off, a major setback for the decades-long conservation effort. Jill Replogle / LAist 5. A suspect fleeing the scene of a San Francisco disturbance tossed a pipe bomb and molotov cocktail out the window of his vehicle at pursuing squad cars. The chase began in the early evening when officers responded to a report of an assault at the famous Saints Peter and Paul Church. Nobody was hurt, and California Highway Patrol eventually took the unidentified man into custody. Police warned residents to report any suspicious devices found on the streets.

To start the week, I’m reading about how California’s top burger joint is right here in Los Angeles. Onto the five USC, LA and California stories you need to know for today. 1. USC graduate student workers won’t strike this week thanks to a Sunday evening deal struck with the university. Negotiators now hold tentative agreements in every category of the contract. Broadly, the terms include a minimum stipend of $40,000; five days of sick leave and a separate five days of bereavement leave per academic year; and a pool of $250,000 to assist workers facing financial hardship. Staff / Daily Trojan 2. For the first time in decades, the California prison system plans to nearly double wages for incarcerated workers — resulting in a maximum hourly wage of 74 cents. Prison officials say the higher pay will help inmates pay damages they owe for their crimes and save money before leaving prison. Reform advocates are skeptical, noting that the change will only bump pay by a few dollars every day. Anabel Sosa / Los Angeles Times 3. A video showed two LA County deputies punching an amputee while restraining him in a chokehold last week. The family of Alejandro Hernandez, 34, said he was washing his truck when deputies suddenly pulled up and began harassing him. The sheriff’s department said East LA deputies recognized Hernandez as an active gang member and suspected he had a firearm hidden under his waistband. Authorities said Hernandez, an ex-felon, was arrested after deputies recovered a loaded handgun. The sheriff’s department is investigating use of force in the incident. Vivian Chow / KTLA 4. A Northern California school board trustee was issued a retraining order after he claimed to be “the messiah chosen by God” to bring about the end of the world and threatened kill children in manifestos loaded with expletives and racial slurs. The Belleview Elementary School District in Sonora said it’s working with the state attorney general’s office to remove 50-year-old Jason Vassar from his elected post. Alex MacLean / The Union Democrat 5. It’s become something of a cliche to say that Californians are fleeing the state’s high prices and politics for Texas. But it turns out there’s a twist. Census data shows that 42,279 Texans moved to California in 2022, making the Lone Star State the biggest contributor of new California residents out of any state in the union — by a wide margin. Still, though, 102,442 Californians moved to Texas that same year. Andrea Guzmán / Chron.com You’re all caught up. Thanks for reading Morning, Trojan, and have a good day.

Here are the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. USC hiked its undergraduate tuition to $66,640 for the 2023-2024 academic year, a 5% increase that’s the same pace as this year’s raise — but still twice as much as years prior. The total estimated cost of attendance including dining, housing and supplies sits at a whopping $90,921. Most sources already rank USC among the top 10 most expensive universities in the United States. Tess Patton / Annenberg Media 2. The blizzard response in the San Bernardino County mountains has left snowed-in residents miffed with local authorities. It’s taken days — in some cases, weeks — for officials to plow roads and reopen stranded communities, even having received prior warning from forecasters. Those officials pointed to a lack of prior experience dealing with blizzards and a similar lack of proper snow-clearing equipment. Staff / Los Angeles Times 3. Anti-abortion activists are increasingly turning their attention to California despite the state’s seemingly unwavering support of reproductive rights. “It’s a game of offense now, not defense,” said one activist who’s moving to the state from Texas to fight for the anti-abortion movement. On paper, California’s abortion protections appear untouchable — but overturning Roe v. Wade was once a similarly tall task. Erin Allday / San Francisco Chronicle 4. Three LA City Council members proposed legislation that would enshrine LA’s “sanctuary city” status into permanent law. The city is currently operating under a 2017 executive order issued by former Mayor Eric Garcetti that limited the city’s involvement with federal immigration authorities. But that method is subject to the whims of future leaders, the council members say, unlike codified protections. Linh Tat / Los Angeles Daily News 5. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s proposed budget nearly halved funding for projects that would protect California’s coast as lawmakers seek to balance the state’s projected $22.5 billion deficit. Those coastal resilience programs would offer grants to local governments looking to protect beaches, homes and infrastructure against rising sea levels. Some lawmakers proposed turning to federal funding to boost those projects. Julie Cart / CalMatters You’re all caught up. Thanks for reading Morning, Trojan, and have a good day.

Franco Gutierrez / Daily Trojan 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] It’s the season of specious college rankings, and the first results are in: USC is the 27th-best college in America, but #1 for “student life,” according to Niche. “Celebrities, parties, networking,” wrote one reviewer. “Everyone is dripped out.” Niche 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC’s budget crisis has, for the last year, largely spared undergraduate academic programs from known direct cuts.

It’s Friday, and we’d recommend checking out Annenberg Media’s interactive guide to the Festival of Books. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. USC ignored repeated complaints about the presence of toxic chemicals in the basement of a School of Cinematic Arts building — until a student was hospitalized for chemical inhalation. The smell was originally thought to stem from a gas leak, but was later determined to come from a bucket of drain cleaner fluid left unattended. Chemicals in that fluid are known to cause respiratory irritation. Jennifer Nehrer / Daily Trojan 2. The LA Police Department suspended a bomb squad member who put too many fireworks in a containment vessel to be detonated, setting off a blast that tore apart a South LA neighborhood in 2021. An investigation found that the officer weighed the explosives “by hand,” mistaking 16.5 pounds for 42. The containment vessel’s capacity was 33 pounds. Josh Cain / Los Angeles Daily News 3. California lawmakers voted to protect sexual assault survivors from retaliatory lawsuits in a bill that passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. The bill protects comments about sexual assault or harassment against defamation lawsuits so long as the allegations aren’t knowingly false or reckless, and was written in reaction to a 2017 case where a former state lawmaker sued a woman over her sexual misconduct allegations against him. Sophie Austin / Associated Press 4. A federal judge refused to approve a settlement to a lawsuit that accused LA County and the city of LA of failing the homeless population. The judge questioned whether the county’s terms of the settlement — which would involve opening over 1,500 new beds in residential facilities for people with severe mental illnesses at risk of homelessness — are anything but the “bare minimum.” Rebecca Ellis / Los Angeles Times 5. Two California men who spent 17 years behind bars after being wrongfully convicted of attempted murder were declared innocent and will be awarded $140 for every day they spent in prison, or about $900,000. Dupree Glass and Juan Rayford were 17 and 18 respectively when they were accused of being involved in a Lancaster shooting that a gang member, who’s serving a life sentence in an unrelated case, would later confess to.

Tomo Chien / Morning, Trojan 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Many college students who won highly coveted internships in the federal government have since seen their summer offers revoked. One USC student who was supposed to intern at the State Department said he was left scrambling to make new plans after his offer was pulled. “I was kinda expecting it,” he said. “Still very frustrating.” Benjamin Gamson / Annenberg Media 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC is seeking to dismiss itself from a lawsuit filed by the parents of a Chapman cinematographer who died in an off-road vehicle crash while on set with USC film students in 2022. The school argued it’s not liable in part because it never approved the shoot, and because the deceased student was not wearing a seat belt.

Jaweed Kaleem / Los Angeles Times 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Little-known fact: Kamala Harris spends more time in Brentwood than in any place outside of Washington. Her neighbors in the posh LA neighborhood are pissed — the Secret Service, apparently, is constantly shutting down their street. “I will vote for her if she agrees to sell her house,” one neighbor said. Erich Schwartzel / The Wall Street Journal 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A California company is using a robot that looks like a World War I tank to carry out prescribed burns — a process where fire-prevention teams burn dry vegetation in a controlled setting so future wildfires have less fuel.

Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC, which seems to have recently found a special knack for pissing people off, said it won’t allow this year’s valedictorian to speak at graduation — citing threats it received over her pro-Palestinian views. Asna Tabassum, the valedictorian, links to a webpage on her Instagram profile calling for Israel to be abolished and replaced by a Palestinian state in which Arabs and Jews live together: which had spurred a wave of online outrage from pro-Israel groups. It is unclear what the nature of the threats were. But what is clear is that USC has managed to spark a nearly unprecedented firestorm of student outrage. Jaweed Kaleem / Los Angeles Times 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Elsewhere in the world of domestic strife over the Israel-Hamas war, a group of pro-Palestinian protestors shut down the Golden Gate Bridge and a major Bay Area highway, snarling the Monday morning commute.

Demonstrators also staged less disruptive sister protests in downtown LA and USC . Eli Rosenberg and Jessica Flores / San Francisco Chronicle 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] California sued to block a new law in Huntington Beach that could require voters to show identification before casting ballots starting 2026. State Attorney General Rob Bonta, a Democrat, said the measure conflicts with state law and could make it harder for marginalized groups to vote. The conservative bastion has in recent years become a battleground for the culture wars, having just recently passed legislation to ban Pride flags on city property. Amy Taxin / Associated Press 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Federal officials finally shut down a scandal-plagued women’s prison in Northern California known as the “rape club” that had faced years of investigations into rampant staff-on-inmate sexual abuse. The closure of the Dublin prison comes after a judge ordered special oversight of the facility and the FBI raided the premises earlier this month. The director of the federal Bureau of Prisons said the facility was “not meeting expected standards and the best course of action is to close the facility.” It’s the first closure of a federal prison since 2021. Sam Levin / The Guardian 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Your tortillas could soon have a new ingredient. A California lawmaker introduced a bill that would require manufacturers of corn masa flour — used to make corn chips, tortillas, tamales and pupusas — to include folic acid in their products. When consumed by pregnant women, folic acid can help prevent serious birth defects. It’s long been required in enriched grain products like cereal, bread, pasta and rice, but the lawmaker said he introduced the bill because Latinas are statistically less likely than other groups to consume folic acid in the early weeks of pregnancy.

USC students might soon be able to benefit from a $25 laundry stipend thanks to an Undergraduate Student Government proposal. The stipend, which is still in the works, could pull from the current printing allowance for students in USC Housing or change it so it can be used for both printing and laundry. Running a wash and dry cycle in USC laundry rooms typically costs around $3. The proposal is still accepting student feedback. Staff / Annenberg Media 2. California nursing homes are admitting a staggering number of patients with serious mental health illnesses, and are in many cases unqualified to care for them. A woman with schizophrenia was found face down in the rain 12 miles from her nursing home, and later died of hypothermia. A man with schizoaffective disorder was released to an unlicensed group home without proper planning, where he died of sepsis after eating his own feces. Experts say state and local governments could be in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act for failing to provide community-based care for the seniors. Elly Yu / LAist and Elisabeth Gawthorp / APM Research Lab 3. California water regulators ruled that the company that sells Arrowhead bottled water must stop siphoning millions of gallons from springs in the San Bernardino Mountains. Advocates have pushed for the ban ever since a 2015 revelation that the U.S. Forest Service was allowing Nestlé to draw water from the mountains with a long-expired permit. Environmentalists say that removing the precious water has had a detrimental effect on the forest’s ecosystem. Ian James / Los Angeles Times 4. Sacramento County’s top prosecutor sued the city of Sacramento over its failure to remove homeless people from the streets. District Attorney Thien Ho alleged that the city’s lax enforcement has left homeless people to suffer in “Third World” conditions, and neighbors to endure threats of violence. The suit, filed by a Democrat prosecutor against a Democrat-led city, is the latest sign of growing tensions in the state’s homelessness crisis. Shawn Hubler and Soumya Karlamangla / The New York Times 5. Southern California Planned Parenthood workers are unionizing after seeing a 16% increase in abortions since the end of Roe v. Wade. Many clinics have observed a sharp increase in out-of-state patients who hail from places with abortion restrictions.

But behind closed doors, one fact is already clear: Sizable layoffs are inevitable, according to multiple sources involved in high-level discussions. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “There is no other way around it,” said one financial official who asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak to the press. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Officials at academic units said they were scrambling over the weekend to balance their books. Many must submit budget proposals to the provost’s office this week — some as soon as Monday. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Schools must cut an average of 5% of their budgets while administrative units must cut 10%, internal documents show. Even under normal circumstances, those would be intimidating numbers. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] But because USC’s ongoing financial crisis has already eroded many non-personnel expenses, there’s not much left to cut, officials say. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “You must be wasting a lot of money in materials and supplies, travel, and other expenditures to be able to find 5% of your overall budget in those categories,” said one person with knowledge of university finances. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Staff are expected to bear the brunt of the layoffs, though non-tenured faculty are also at risk “if they don’t find enough staff to lay off,” one official said. Complicating matters is that the reduction percentages are deceptively low, the official added. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Under USC’s financial structure, all schools — Dornsife, Viterbi, Keck, et al. — must divert a large share of their revenue to the university’s central administration to cover common overhead costs. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Research-intensive schools might spend 35% of their revenue on these taxes, while a teaching-focused school might spend as much as 55%, according to the Academic Senate . The remaining money is generally what they can spend on school-specific expenses, like faculty salaries and supplies. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The catch is that a 5% budget reduction is calculated using the school’s total revenue — not what it actually has left to spend after university taxes, one official said. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] If a school earns $1 million from tuition and other sources, a 5% reduction means it must cleave $50,000 in spending. But if half its revenue still goes toward university taxes, the school effectively has 10% less cash to work with. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC has seen several layoffs over the last year, though sources privy to budgeting discussions said they expect the imminent round to be more dramatic. One said that, under federal law, USC will likely have to file a WARN Act notice, which requires large employers to notify employees 60 days ahead of a mass layoff. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] University policy dictates the following terms regarding severance and insurance: Employees who’ve worked four or fewer full (cumulative) years at USC receive four weeks of severance. They’ll get four weeks of health insurance premiums. Employees who’ve worked five or more (cumulative) full years receive one week of severance for each full year worked. The same math applies to health insurance premiums. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] View the full policy here . p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Got a tip? (SBOs: I’m looking at you.)

(Henry Kofman / Daily Trojan) p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The destruction was unfathomable. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Sophomore Ella Zarrow fled her childhood home in Pacific Palisades Tuesday. Days later, when her father returned, the news he sent back was grim. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The entire house was burned to rubble. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “It’s hard to wrap my head around,” Zarrow said. “Everything is gone.” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Zarrow is among an unknown number of USC students, faculty, and staff who’ve lost their homes — or been temporarily displaced — as the Palisades and Eaton fires continue their blitz through Los Angeles County. Zarrow’s childhood home in Pacific Palisades was completely destroyed. (Ella Zarrow) p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The fires have razed more than 12,000 structures and killed at least 11 people , the LA Fire Department said. They are on track to become the costliest set of wildfires in U.S. history. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Morning, Trojan identified over a dozen USC community members whose homes have been destroyed through GoFundMe listings. But the real number is likely several orders of magnitude higher given USC’s more than 22,000 full-time employees and 47,000 students, many of whom are certain to live in the vast affected areas. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A USC spokesperson said it is too soon to know the exact number of displaced community members, citing the rapidly changing situation. The school is not aware of any deaths or critical injuries, the spokesperson added. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Multiple sources privy to high-level discussions at USC said officials have floated preliminary numbers in internal meetings based on self-reports and HR address data, but they were unable to provide a reliable count. They asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak to the press. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The spring semester will begin according to schedule on Monday. In Altadena, the fast-moving Eaton fire has leveled entire suburban neighborhoods. (Jordan Renville) The Palisades fire has sent a thick layer of smoke over Santa Monica. (Anthony Clingerman) p span[style*=\"font-size\"] When doctoral candidate Ariyana Griffin left her Altadena home Tuesday night, she could see the flames tearing through the nearby Eaton Canyon. This was the last thing she needed: Griffin’s father had unexpectedly died on Christmas Eve. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Now, still grieving her father, she packed a few bare essentials and keepsakes into the car, then fled to her brother’s home in Orange. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] When her mom and brother returned the next day, the charred ruins of their flattened home were still so hot they couldn’t walk through the rubble. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “We’re trying to take it day by day,” Griffin said. “The future is really hard to think about right now.” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Griffin, who graduated with her bachelor’s last May, had planned to return to USC to pursue a doctorate in occupational therapy. The plan was to commute from home, as she had for the previous four years. Now, though, that’s all in the air. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “My mom wants me to go, but I don’t want to make a selfish decision,” Griffin said, worrying about the cost of tuition while her family starts from scratch. Griffin’s home was reduced to rubble by the Eaton fire. (Ariyana Griffin) p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Sabrina Bates stood outside her Altadena home of 26 years on Wednesday and felt the hot gusts of the Santa Ana winds blowing through the suburban corridor. For the previous 24 hours, the Eaton fire had rampaged unchecked through the town. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Still, when the evacuation order came, the USC nurse practitioner and her husband packed “optimistically.” She thought they were coming back. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Now, her side of the street is completely flattened. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “Life can change in an instant,” Bates said. “We&#39;re not promised tomorrow.” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Bates said the outpouring of love and support she’s received from her USC colleagues has moved her. She’s worked at the USC Keck School of Medicine since 2016, but only started at the Headache and Neuralgia Center in November. Those co-workers are now organizing a GoFundMe campaign for her and other displaced staff. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Ana Gjurgevich, a colleague of Bates’, lives just two doors down. They often carpool together. Her home was likewise destroyed in the flames after she fled with her husband, dog, and 18-month-old child. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] On Friday, a Samaritan dropped off baby clothes at her parents’ house and Gjurgevich said she “broke down.” The chimney was one of the only recognizable parts of Gjurgevich’s home left standing. (Ana Gjurgevich) p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “It’s just so beautiful how communities get together and support each other during these times,” Gjurgevich said. “And being on the receiving end, you see it more, feel it more.

In yesterday’s newsletter, we wrote that California healthcare workers are no longer required to vaccinate or mask as COVID restrictions phase out.

Andrew Guzman, a legal scholar and economist, will serve as USC’s next provost — the most influential university role second only to the president.

Libor Jany and Richard Winton / Los Angeles Times 3. California K-12 public schools managed to largely level off the pandemic-fueled enrollment decline this year. Statewide enrollment dropped by just 40,000 in the fall, compared to 160,000 in the fall of 2020. Some districts saw as little as a 0.01% decline, staving off fears of budget cuts — state funding is based on enrollment and attendance. Jill Tucker / San Francisco Chronicle 4. LA’s new property tax is in a state of limbo. Measure ULA, approved by 58% of voters in November, is meant to fund affordable housing and address homelessness. But two lawsuits threaten to block the tax, meaning the city must collect the money but decide whether to incur the risk of actually spending the funds — because it’s possible the lawsuits will prevail and the money will have to be returned.

Yesterday, I linked to a story in Los Angeles Magazine reporting that pro-Palestinian demonstrators at UCLA shouted “beat that f——— Jew” while smashing a piñata bearing the image of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. I checked the original video myself that morning and believed that’s what the protestors did in fact say, but after listening again, it sounds like that may not actually be the case; a single demonstrator shouting into a megaphone seems to say two syllables after the expletive, which would disqualify the word “Jew.” I now believe that LA Magazine is mistaken in its reporting, and apologize for linking to that story. I’ve also asked UCLA’s press office whether a statement Chancellor Gene Block issued — parts of which I included in yesterday’s summary — was referencing the piñata incident specifically, as the magazine reported. You’ll be the first to know when I get a reply. Special thank you to the subscriber who pointed this out to me. Onto the five (other) USC, LA and California stories you need to know for today. 1. A prominent USC neuroscientist was accused of doctoring data to suggest that an experimental drug developed to limit brain damage after strokes was effective — when in fact preliminary data suggested the drug actually increased deaths. Former members of Berislav Zlokovic’s lab described a culture of intimidation in which Zlokovic frequently pushed them to alter lab notebooks to ensure they contained only the desired results. And forensic image analysts said some of Zlokovic’s published images appear to be digitally manipulated. Charles Piller / Science 2. A USC professor was put on administrative leave for comments he made at a pro-Palestinian rally on Thursday that drew heavy criticism and calls for his resignation.

(Jason Goode) p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Multiple USC doctoral programs are rescinding Ph.D. admission offers because of “uncertainty” in federal funding and the school’s ongoing financial woes, according to memos obtained by Morning, Trojan and university sources familiar with the matter. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Students who already accepted offers were unaffected; only applicants who haven’t accepted pending offers are subject to the revocations. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] At least four Dornsife departments — chemistry, sociology, molecular biology, and religion — were ordered to rescind offers, but it was not immediately clear how many other programs or schools were affected. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A USC spokesperson did not answer questions about how widespread the cuts were, noting only that Ph.D. admissions are the purview of individual schools. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “Financial challenges across Dornsife and the university, combined with external research funding uncertainties, are putting significant strain on our budget,” Steven Finkel, Dornsife’s dean of graduate education, wrote in a Friday memo to the school’s department chairs and directors of graduate studies. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Ph.D. programs typically budget for a set number of students but extend more offers than that, knowing not all applicants will choose USC. In a normal year, it’s not a problem if a program inadvertently accepts a few too many students. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Now, though, the school will hold affected programs to a hard cap, forcing faculty to revoke outstanding offers once their seats fill. In interviews, multiple applicants described traveling to USC after receiving acceptance letters, then planning to attend the school — only to receive the unwelcome news. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Dornsife circulated two template letters for programs to send to affected applicants. The first offers the option to enroll in fall 2026 without reapplying, but notes that it’s unclear whether that cycle will face similar enrollment limits. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The second is an outright revocation that provides no such deferral option. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] This was not entirely unexpected. In February, USC briefly paused Ph.D. admissions after the Trump administration slashed overhead funding that the National Institutes of Health traditionally bundles with research grants, STAT reported. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] For weeks, other U.S. universities have paused, reduced, and rescinded graduate admissions in response to the NIH cuts. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Finkel’s memo to graduate school faculty notes that, “possibly due to other institutions cutting back on Ph.D. admissions,” Dornsife has seen a 15% increase in acceptances of doctoral offers compared to the same time last year. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] An “unprecedented” number of programs have already filled their seats ahead of the school’s April 15 decision deadline, Finkel wrote. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] In contrast to Finkel’s memo — which in part blamed USC’s financial woes that predated Donald Trump’s inauguration — the school’s external communications blame only federal funding for the revoked admissions. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The decisions were made “in light of uncertainty regarding federal research funding,” a USC spokesperson wrote. Dornsife’s template letters include similar verbiage. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The discrepancy underscored the increasingly blurred lines between USC’s recent barrage of budget cuts due to an arguably self-inflicted budget deficit , and those driven by White House policy. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] On Wednesday, Provost Andrew Guzman told the Faculty Senate that if the university doesn’t receive a financial shock from the federal government, its operating deficit will vanish by the end of the next fiscal year, the Daily Trojan reported. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] But, he said, it’s “overwhelmingly likely” that USC will lose hundreds of millions in federal funding thanks to Trump’s executive orders. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Got a tip?

Tomo Chien October 25, 2024 A common word used in conversations with Morning, Trojan was “livid.” (Courtesy Gina Nguyen) p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC plans to significantly cut key benefits that pay college tuition for the children of faculty and staff, according to interviews and documents obtained by Morning, Trojan. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The school has not officially announced the cuts to all its employees, but plans to do so next week. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “It’s truly seismic,” said James Moore, a professor emeritus who was present at a Faculty Senate meeting where the cuts were presented. “They’re going to go absolutely apeshit.” A screenshot of a presentation to the Faculty Senate last Friday obtained by Morning, Trojan. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] At question is the school’s long-running Tuition Assistance Benefits program. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] As it currently stands , USC will fully fund undergraduate tuition for all the children of most full-time faculty and staff. That will not change under the cuts, according to documents viewed by Morning, Trojan. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The school, however, will no longer pay for the 72 graduate units it currently offers if employees choose to pass up on undergraduate aid. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Multiple faculty members told Morning, Trojan in interviews that they chose to forgo tuition assistance for their children’s ongoing undergraduate degrees and instead saved it for graduate school. They will no longer be able to cash in on that benefit under the planned cuts. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC also currently promises to pay tuition for the children of employees who work at the school for more than 15 years, even if they later leave their jobs. That benefit is now on the chopping block, too, which will in theory penalize the university’s most loyal employees. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “They have had the rug pulled out from under them,” Moore said of employees hoping to cash in on the 15-year benefit. “They’ve invested many years and they’ll have to invest many more than they planned on the job.” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Children who currently enjoy the 15-year benefit, though, will continue to receive it through completion of their degree. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The planned cuts will also axe assistance for graduate certificates, lower the maximum age for children eligible to receive the benefits, and trim assistance for spouses of employees. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] No staff or non-tenured faculty contacted by Morning, Trojan were willing to discuss the cuts on the record for fear of retribution. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “I’m pissed off — but not surprised,” said one faculty member, adding that there has been an “erosion of benefits” and USC’s professed values over the last several years. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “It has been the talk of the faculty and staff,” said another faculty member. “Emotions are running high. It’s created a lot of anxiety among the employees of the university.” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Multiple USC faculty members said they’ve heard rumors of the cuts since at least last Wednesday. They were announced at a Staff Assembly meeting as well as the Faculty Senate meeting last week, according to people familiar with the matter. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A common word used in conversations with Morning, Trojan was “livid.” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] In a statement, USC indicated that it has not yet finalized the cuts. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “Like most organizations, we evaluate our operations to ensure our long-term financial resilience,” the university wrote. “We have been evaluating changes, including to our Tuition Assistance Benefit, and plan to finalize and announce those next week.” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] If you’re new here, check out this week’s scoop about a stunning failure in USC’s cybersecurity protocol.

The total estimated cost of attendance including housing, meals, and books now sits at $99,139. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Still, the sticker price can be somewhat misleading. The school says that nearly two-thirds of its undergraduates receive need-based or merit aid, and a typical student whose family earns under $80,000 attends class tuition-free. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] In the past, USC has argued that price hikes allow it to disburse more financial aid. That policy mirrors a general trend in higher education, which has seen universities essentially redistribute money from their wealthiest students to their most needy. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC undergraduate tuition has consistently outpaced U.S. inflation for the last two decades, with the exception of two years during the pandemic that saw astronomical inflation. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Tuition is one of the university’s biggest sources of revenue.

Faculty said in interviews that they were “pissed.” Some employees even started organizing groups to protest the cuts — and have suggested that legal action is a possibility. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “We apologize for any confusion and ensuing frustration that has arisen over the past week,” USC wrote in a letter sent to its full-time employees."},{"slug":"usc-rich-kids-walk-on","title":"USC admits shitty rich kids as walk-on athletes","date":1729608633000,"web_exclusive":false,"content":".bh__byline_wrapper .bh__byline_social_wrapper .bh__byline_social_wrapper > * + * @media (min-width: 768px) .bh__byline_social_wrapper } USC admits shitty rich kids as walk-on athletes Tomo Chien October 22, 2024 p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Good morning.

Benjamin Oreskes / Los Angeles Times 3. A legal advocacy group sued USC, alleging the university defrauded prospective students by promoting misleading U.S. News &amp; World Report rankings. The suit alleges that USC’s Rossier School of Education used rankings for its in-person programs — which were already based on false information the school submitted — to highlight its online programs, which are based on entirely different criteria. Melissa Korn / The Wall Street Journal 4. The University of California strike is over.

We did it to Carol Folt&#39;s. Tomo Chien & Anna Hsu October 20, 2024 USC wasn’t fully aware of the problem before it was contacted for this story. (Illustration by Tomoki Chien) p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A stunning lapse in cybersecurity protocol allows anybody to send fake emails from any usc.edu address — containing any content, to any person. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Morning, Trojan reporters successfully sent mail from the real addresses of USC President Carol Folt, Provost Andrew Guzman, and the school’s public relations team. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC’s IT department said it was previously aware of vulnerabilities in its email protocol — but not the full extent until it was contacted for this story. It is actively working to resolve the problem, a spokesperson said, adding that it is a violation of the school’s Acceptable Use Policy to spoof emails. A spoofed (fake) email shown on the Apple Mail app. It is impossible to tell the email is fake from the contact card. This address belongs to Folt’s office, and is not her direct inbox. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The cyberattack, known as spoofing, exploits vulnerabilities in esoteric mail protocol that the layperson is likely unaware of. But given abundant online resources, it is relatively easy to learn to spoof even with a limited technical background. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The results could be dangerous. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] In tests, Morning, Trojan reporters found that spoofed emails are often indistinguishable from their real counterparts. Google profile photos transfer to the spoofs and recipients can reply to the sender’s legitimate inbox. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] It is theoretically possible to spoof emails from any USC address, including university departments, student clubs, and the Department of Public Safety. Spoofs can land in inboxes of any email domain — not just usc.edu addresses. A spoofed email shown on the Apple Mail app — at the expense of our good friends at USC public relations. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] It is sometimes possible to detect a spoof by examining the header, which is a hidden section of code at the top of the email. But the results are not consistent. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Morning, Trojan reporters successfully spoofed emails on USC servers while connected to home WiFi networks. Spoofers do not need access to a legitimate USC email account to initiate an attack, either. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] That means bad actors could initiate attacks regardless of proximity or affiliation to USC, though the school’s IT department said it was working rapidly to fix the problem on Sunday afternoon. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Morning, Trojan held publication of this story for 48 hours to give USC time to patch some of the most egregious security vulnerabilities. A spokesperson said to forward any suspicious mail to security@usc.edu , which can verify whether the content is real. A spoofed email in the Gmail app. This address belongs to Guzman’s office, and is not his direct inbox. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The results aren’t always perfect. In some instances, Gmail appeared to identify the spoofs as spam, but they still landed in the recipient’s inbox. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] That’s likely because of specific configurations in USC’s servers that ensure mail from important addresses does not go unseen, though a USC spokesperson did not respond when asked if that’s the case. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Spoofs do not appear in the victim’s “sent” tab, and spoofers cannot access a victim’s inbox. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] In an interview, Sandra Taylor — USC’s chief information and security officer — said the IT department will roll out a feature that flags suspected spoofs with banners in Gmail inboxes. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Roughly half of the school’s staff email addresses already have the feature but few students and faculty do, Taylor said. On Sunday morning, she said it’ll take seven to 10 days to implement the warnings in every inbox; later that evening, a spokesperson said the rollout should be done within 48 hours. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Taylor said the university has long been aware that its email system is vulnerable to spoofing. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “We&#39;ve known it’s an outdated technology,” she said. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The problem is that much of the university’s infrastructure, like printers and older security cameras, relies on the archaic protocol, she said. It will be a mammoth task to overhaul the system. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Patching vulnerabilities has already disabled some of those devices, Taylor said, though the IT department is working to get them back online. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] When asked why USC has not already patched a vulnerability that it has — in part — known about for years, Taylor cited the school’s Acceptable Use Policy that bans spoofing, and the alerts that appear in a limited number of staff inboxes. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “We had these other layers while we were chipping away at these devices,” Taylor said. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The IT department is working at an accelerated pace to fix the problem now, she said, adding that while spoofing is a “serious” problem, her department also regularly fends off sophisticated attacks from foreign actors and cybercriminals. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “A lot of times our eyes are on that,” Taylor said. Carol Folt is very pleased with her “Moron of the Year” trophy in this spoofed email. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC is not the only U.S. university with glaring cybersecurity vulnerabilities. A viral Twitter thread earlier this week showed that the Massachusetts Institute of Technology suffers from many of the same security lapses, although spoofers need access to a real mit.edu address to execute an attack. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A student in 2013 attempted to cancel classes at MIT with a universitywide spoofed email, though that evidently did not convince the university to fix the problem. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “We were alerted to an email security concern and immediately engaged our information technology and cybersecurity teams,” a USC spokesperson said. “The university is always diligently working to protect campus systems and data.” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Reach us at tomo@morningtrojan.com ."},{"slug":"usc-student-allegedly-raped-by-lyft-driver","title":"USC student allegedly raped by Lyft driver","date":1698937574000,"web_exclusive":false,"content":"*|MC_PREVIEW_TEXT|* View this email in your browser By Tomoki Chien and Salome Nebiyu Good morning.

Hunter Lee / Los Angeles Daily News 4. A California woman was charged with 63 felony and misdemeanor counts for allegedly hosting alcohol-fueled parties where she encouraged her teenage son and his friends to sexually assault girls in 2020. Shannon Marie O’Connor, who is 49 — and also better known as the “Los Gatos Party Mom” — allegedly bought beer, vodka and whiskey for the 14- and 15-year-olds and encouraged them to drink to the point of unconsciousness. Prosecutors say she not only encouraged sexual assault, but at one point watched and laughed while a drunk boy raped a girl in bed. O’Connor remains in jail without bail. Staff / Associated Press 5. Shasta County residents are bracing themselves for turmoil in an election next Tuesday. Last spring, the county’s far-right leadership — swept up in voter fraud conspiracies — opted to ditch its voting machines and instead hand-count ballots. In response, Gov. Gavin Newsom introduced legislation limiting counties from hand-counting votes, but county leaders contend the law doesn’t apply to them. Now, the county registrar is refusing to comply with demands from Shasta leadership and is instead forging ahead with a plan to use voting machines in the election — drawing ire from residents and setting the stage for drama on Tuesday.

As president of the USC College Republicans, he had a knack for stirring controversy. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] After Zohran Mamdani won New York City’s Democratic primary in June, Driemeyer signed off on an Instagram story that read “NYC has forgotten” under a photo of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

COVID’s footprint has all but faded from USC. Come May 19, the university will no longer require the primary vaccination series and boosters for students in non-health degree programs. It’ll also permanently shut down testing tents and stop requiring a negative antigen test after five days to leave isolation. Claire Qiu / Daily Trojan 2. New forecasts show that California flood risks will linger through much of the year as warm weather melts the record Sierra Nevada snowpack. The Tulare Lake and San Joaquin River basins remain at the highest risk, sitting directly in the pack of the mammoth snowpack that’s 249% its normal size for the date. Hayley Smith / Los Angeles Times 3. The Biden administration preliminarily suggested evenly splitting Colorado River allotments between California, Nevada and Arizona. Such an allotment could drastically reduce the amount of water delivered to California, which currently has the most senior rights to the river; it would also put an end to the ceaseless interstate bickering over the matter. Christopher Flavelle / The New York Times 4. Graduate students in USC’s school of social work are petitioning the university to compensate them for unpaid internships required by the master’s in social work program, staging a 100-person walkout Tuesday in support of the cause. Internships, typically unpaid and intended to arm students with real-world experience, are required by all accredited schools of social work. Tomoki Chien / Daily Trojan 5. A growing chorus of Democratic activists and journalists is calling for Sen. Dianne Feinstein to resign after reports that her absence from Congress as she recovers from shingles has made it harder for the Senate to confirm President Biden’s judicial nominees. Feinstein holds a key seat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and her absence paired with Sen. John Fetterman’s (D-Pa) has whittled the chamber’s Democratic majority to nothing.

Tomo Chien February 23, 2025 p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A USC student government candidate colloquially known as “ the beer guy ” was disqualified from holding office after allegedly using “excessively crude” language throughout his senate campaign, according to an unpublished document obtained by Morning, Trojan. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Mason Yonover, whose policy agenda includes encouraging smoking on campus and turning sorority houses into homeless shelters, has become something of a micro-celebrity for his expletive-laden social media posts and outlandish campaign proposals. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Voting for this year’s elections closes Sunday evening. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The nearly 4,000-word report penned by the Undergraduate Student Government’s judicial council accuses Yonover of violating its code of ethics by routinely espousing vulgar language. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] It cites over a dozen instances of apparently crude language, including: A pre-Super Bowl Instagram story that read: “Vote Yonover for senate if you fucking hate the fucking fucking Chiefs, man.” An Instagram post that lamented the end of “Jerk It January.” An Instagram story that read: “Just to put a button on it… I would’ve killed baby Hitler.” An Instagram story that read: “Vote Mason Yonover for USG Senate. Y’all fuck with the new campaign poster?” A remark at the annual senatorial forum where Yonover in part said: “Nobody gives a shit about USG.” A stream of F-bomb-laden remarks directed at senate candidate Dakota Driemeyer after Driemeyer said he voted for Donald Trump at the senatorial forum. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “Candidates are expected to uphold respectful discourse that fosters constructive conversation, rather than resorting to language that undermines the professionalism required by the Elections Code,” the council wrote. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Yonover, whose name is still on the ballot , said he will appeal the ruling but declined to comment further. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Driemeyer, who lodged the complaint against Yonover alongside a member of the judicial council, said the decision to disqualify Yonover was “correct.” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “We need folks who can spread their ideas in a rational and professional manner, not a voice that seeks to demean and cheapen the very integrity of the organization,” Driemeyer wrote in a statement. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Driemeyer himself has taken fire on social media for opening his campaign with a now-deleted post pledging to fight the “woke agenda.” He has styled himself as a voice for conservative students on campus, and recently called on USC to defund the beleaguered Daily Trojan newspaper. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Pending appeal, Yonover, a sophomore studying creative writing, is disqualified from this year’s election but could run again in the future so long as he doesn’t run further afoul of the student government’s rulebook. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Yonover previously told the Daily Trojan that he was running on a “campaign of indifference.” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] He has mourned the recent lack of Varsity Blues-style admissions scandals at USC (“We need to get the brand back on its feet man”), and called on the student government to invest its roughly $2.5 million annual budget in sports betting (“Absolute lock of a parlay”). p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Student government senators earn a $3,600 annual stipend paid for by undergraduate tuition fees. Senators tend to serve as credentialed advocates for undergraduate interests rather than policymakers with real authority outside the confines of the student government. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Still, they can carry weight. Senators last year helped overturn a largely unpopular scholarship cut , and have continued to rail against similar cuts as the cash-strapped university dramatically pares back its spending. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] They have helped implement vending machines with affordable medicine, contraceptives, and hygiene products, and have perpetually pushed for popular measures such as making USCards Apple Wallet-compatible. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] But Yonover’s disqualification adds to the general clownishness of this year’s elections, which have increasingly come to resemble a caricature of high school student council contests. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Candidates opened the month-long campaign slog by promising to remove seed oils from the dining halls, bring a KFC to campus, start a free shuttle to The Grove, and offer free In-N-Out during finals week. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Presidential candidate John Breitfelder earned a somewhat baffling endorsement from NFL Hall-of-Famer Lynn Swan. Days later, the judicial council slapped Breitfelder with a three-day campaign suspension for touting the supposedly unauthorized endorsement. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Ali Bhatti — a presidential candidate who, in his bid for his current senate seat, promised to bring a Raising Cane’s to campus — has faced several charges of misconduct himself. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] In an 18-page brief that reads something like an FBI affidavit, the judicial council handed Bhatti a four-day suspension for stacking two lawn signs on top of each other. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Bhatti later reported that USC shot down his effort to bring Raising Cane’s to campus. Now, he’s railing for a Shake Shack. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Correction: This story was updated to note that Yonover may run for office again next year so long as he complies with the student government’s orders. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Tomo Chien can be reached at tomo@morningtrojan.com ."},{"slug":"usc-usg-student-government-campaign-promises-bullshit","title":"Our favorite bullshit USG campaign promises","date":1738252797000,"web_exclusive":false,"content":".bh__byline_wrapper .bh__byline_social_wrapper .bh__byline_social_wrapper > * + * @media (min-width: 768px) .bh__byline_social_wrapper } Our favorite bullshit USG campaign promises Tomo Chien January 30, 2025 p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Good morning.

Tomo Chien March 14, 2025 USC President Carol Folt and Provost Andrew Guzman say cuts are needed to avoid future shortfalls. (Tomo Chien) p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A third-party report commissioned by a USC faculty group suggested that the university’s ongoing controversial budget cuts are unnecessary. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The analysis, completed by an accounting professor at Eastern Michigan University, is the first formal report to question the university’s claim in November that it must slash spending to ensure “long-term financial resiliency.” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC has since cut several popular programs — including free tuition for the children of employees, select merit scholarships , and funding for the Daily Trojan newspaper — which has drawn outrage from students and employees. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “The university is crying poverty when there’s no reason to do so,” said Howard Bunsis , the accountant who completed the analysis, in a webinar last week. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC’s chapter of the American Association of University Professors paid Bunsis for his work, a chapter spokesperson said. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The accountant has completed similar analyses at several other schools, most notably the California State University system. Previous universities subject to Bunsis’ scathing reports have described him as “a paid consultant with a pre-conceived agenda.” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A USC spokesperson did not respond to multiple requests for comment about Bunsis’ findings. Claims of budget deficit ‘not supported’ p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The crux of USC’s justification for budget cuts is the fact that it ran on a $158 million operating deficit last school year, meaning it spent more than it made on core services like academic programs and the healthcare system. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] That calculation, however, excludes non-operating income like investment gains and donations to the endowment. All told, USC added over $600 million to its coffers last year, audited financial statements show. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Still, even separate that income, Bunsis’ report contested the notion that drastic budget cuts are needed to avoid future operating deficits, arguing that such projections are unaudited and posed by “overly pessimistic” administrators. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “Any claims of budget ‘holes’ or ‘deficits’ or needs for budget cuts are not supported,” Bunsis wrote. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC has blamed inflation, rising insurance costs, lowering graduate student enrollment, increasingly generous financial aid, and “the rising cost of college athletics” — among other things — for its deficit. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] In its most recent financial statements, the university reported sitting on $11.7 billion of assets. It is not free to spend all its cash, though. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Three-fifths of USC’s assets are donor-restricted, which typically means the school has to wait until a designated time to spend the money. Until then, it can only draw on the interest the donation accrues. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC’s primary reserve ratio — a key measure of financial health that, in this case, is calculated by dividing unrestricted reserves by annual expenses — suggests that if all of the university’s revenue were to abruptly dry up, it could sustain itself for 6.5 months. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The scenario is unrealistic, but it serves as a measure of financial health that Bunsis argued indicates USC is in “excellent” condition. USC’s unrestricted reserves, in thousands. (Howard Bunsis) Months of expense in reserve, in thousands. (Howard Bunsis) p span[style*=\"font-size\"] “I’m not claiming that reserves are a pot of cash sitting in the president’s office,” Bunsis said. But, he added, such robust reserves afford the university significant “financial freedom and flexibility.” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Bunsis’ rosy assessment of USC’s financial health is backed by strong ratings from Moody’s and S&P, two of the so-called “Big Three” credit rating agencies. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Notably, last March, Moody’s downgraded USC’s rating from its second-highest to third-highest tier, citing the university’s underperforming healthcare system. The agency still lauded USC’s “solid revenue growth across its business lines.” p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC has not cited the credit rating or healthcare revenue in any justification for its cost slashing. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Beyond contesting budget cuts, the report could serve as ammunition for faculty during future negotiations at the end of a bitter ongoing union drive . The report does not address Donald Trump’s threats to pull funding from universities that do not comply with his orders. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Check out our live layoff and budget cut tracker .

The next-closest pharmacy to campus is the CVS on the first floor of the University Gateway apartments on the corner of Figueroa and 32nd streets. CVS said it’ll transfer prescriptions to nearby locations “to ensure patients have uninterrupted access to pharmacy care.” Jennifer Nehrer and Jonathan Park / Daily Trojan 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Gov. Gavin Newsom vowed to veto a measure that would’ve banned tackle football for kids under 12, putting an end to what was quickly becoming a parental rights-esque culture war issue. As of late, Newsom has sought to avoid headline-grabbing proposals that cast the state as out-of-touch on cultural issues in a pivotal election year. “I am deeply concerned about the health and safety of our young athletes, but an outright ban is not the answer,” Newsom said. Staff / Politico 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A scathing report found that California’s proposed water restrictions would be too costly and unrealistic to implement. The analysis by the nonpartisan advisors to the state Legislature said that many of the “unnecessarily complex” reduction goals would be nearly impossible to meet, and that they would disproportionately affect lower-income residents. The report recommended extending reduction deadlines and loosening outdoor water use restrictions. Ian James / Los Angeles Times 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Violent crime dropped by 3.2% in LA last year, a decline in crimes like murder, robbery and rape in line with national trends. But theft is up, rising 16% in 2023 and no doubt aided by a string of high-profile smash-and-grab retail theft incidents over the summer. Another phenomenon: Traffic collision deaths are on the rise, and for only the second time in at least a decade, 2023 saw more than 300 murders and 300 automobile-related deaths. Jon Regardie / Crosstown 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] New insider accounts revealed that Kevin Merida, former executive editor of the LA Times, left his role last week after growing tired of newsroom interference by the paper’s billionaire owner, Patrick Soon-Shiong. In particular, the two men clashed over Merida’s decision to ban reporters who signed a letter calling for a ceasefire in Gaza from covering the conflict for 90 days. Soon-Shiong suggested in an interview that he would’ve blocked the decision had he known about it beforehand, and his activist daughter Nika is vocally anti-Israel on social media — unusual behavior for a newspaper-owning family, which Merida bristled at.

Yesterday, the planet’s population hit a milestone 8 billion people; see where you fit in . And now, here’s the news you need to know for today. 1. Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva conceded to challenger Robert Luna. Now set to head the country’s largest sheriff’s department, Luna ran on a platform of reform and “public trust and legitimacy” — positioning himself as the opposite of Villanueva, who often found himself at odds with the county Board of Supervisors throughout his controversial tenure. Frank Stoltze and Emily Elena Dugdale / LAist 2. Rep. Karen Bass again widened her lead over businessman Rick Caruso in the L.A. mayoral race, now 5 percentage points ahead of her opponent a week after Election Day. Experts say Bass appears to be on track to secure the win as county officials continue tallying mail-in ballots. James Rainey / Los Angeles Times 3. In a shocking development for the Bruins, the crosstown rivalry game between No. 7 USC and No. 16 UCLA was declared a sellout; 70,865 fans are expected in attendance Saturday at the typically sleepy Rose Bowl. James H. Williams / Los Angeles Daily News 4. Entire communities in the drought-stricken lowlands of the San Joaquin Valley are relying on bottled water as their wells dry up. Bottled supplies can be the only alternative to the long waitlists — and high costs — of drilling deeper in search of water for those who rely on private wells. Joshua Partlow / The Washington Post 5. Dry, powerful Santa Ana winds are expected to blow through Southern California this week. Coupled with low humidity, officials say the winds threaten to ignite wildfires across the region. Kat Schuster / Patch 6. A proposed desalination plant on the Monterey Peninsula is poised to win approval from the California Coastal Commission this week. Some point to desalination as a solution to drying water supplies statewide, but critics say the process remains too costly and will make water bills unaffordable for low-income residents. Kurtis Alexander / San Francisco Chronicle 7. The California Legislature appears on track to include its most diverse slate of lawmakers ever. Votes are still being tallied, but a record number of female and LGBTQ lawmakers are poised to win seats in the Assembly and Senate; the state could in fact be the first to achieve proportional LGBTQ representation in its legislature.

Freshmen, we did it: The class of 2026 boasts the highest entering average GPA in USC history, a 3.87 on an unweighted 4.0 scale — I saw this in the Daily Trojan yesterday and figured I’d share. Consider this the last time you and I will ever talk about our high school GPAs, SAT scores and AP courses. Here’s the news you need to know for today. 1. If you thought election night was the last of the drama from Sheriff Alex Villanueva, you thought wrong. The Los Angeles County district attorney’s office has opened a criminal investigation into whether Villanueva solicited campaign donations from deputies — a misdemeanor under state law. In a video address, Villanueva asked deputies to pitch in “20 bucks, all the way up to 1,500 bucks” for his race against former Long Beach Police Chief Robert Luna. Villanueva trails Luna by 13.6 percentage points with 44% of the expected vote tallied. Alene Tchekmedyian and James Queally / Los Angeles Times 2. The L.A. mayoral race is still a nail-biter. Businessman Rick Caruso leads Rep. Karen Bass by a few percentage points with less than half of the expected vote tallied. The race has seen the two campaigns collectively pour more than $113 million into advertisements and door-to-door canvassers. Linh Tat / Los Angeles Daily News 3. Young the Giant — yes, Young the Giant — gave an impromptu performance yesterday on campus. The band, which has two Billboard top 10 albums and over 5 million monthly listeners on Spotify, was joined by a quartet of USC performance students who were invited to play last-minute. Hali Mecklin and Shane Dimapanat / Annenberg Media 4. USC is seeing an early surge in flu cases, mirroring the broader L.A. County. It’s not yet clear if this is a small, early spike, or the beginning of a severe and prolonged flu season. Jonathan Park / Daily Trojan 5. The California lottery made its first ever billionaire. The lucky winner bought a Powerball ticket worth more than $2 billion at an Altadena gas station, and lottery officials surprised the gas station owner with a $1 million bonus check for selling the jackpot-winning ticket. Grace Toohey and Gregory Yee / Los Angeles Times 6. Federal health officials are investigating whether a now-defunct California military base exposed veterans to high levels of cancer-causing toxins. An Associated Press investigation earlier this year found that the Army knew chemicals had been improperly dumped at Fort Ord in Monterey County for decades, but sought to play down the risks. Martha Mendoza, Juliet Linderman and Jason Dearen / Associated Press 7. The City of Berkeley could soon ban right turns on red, a move which street safety groups say can help reduce the risk of drivers hitting pedestrians and cyclists. Allowing right turns at red lights hasn’t always been common practice: It started during the gas crisis of the 1970s as an effort to cut down on wasted fuel as drivers idled in intersections.

Making the perfect sweet treat is an “engineering problem,” insisted professor Eyal Ben-Yoseph, who added that students get to taste test their products. CHE 499 is available next semester. Greta Harrison / USC Viterbi 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] In case you missed it: USC will no longer axe a popular benefit that pays tuition for the children of certain longtime employees even after they leave the university.

Share this with a friend 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC student protesters again erected a “Gaza solidarity” encampment that the LAPD seemed poised to clear Saturday evening — until the legions of riot officers inexplicably left campus without confrontation. Other updates: President Folt finally broke her silence to antagonize protesters. Twice . Then declined to answer questions, and scurried away . Some protesters vandalized Tommy Trojan and other iconic USC landmarks. A DPS car nearly swerved into a student journalist. The student government is pissed. High-profile professors are pissed. Even pro-Israel groups are pissed. Notice a theme? Staff / Daily Trojan 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Two speakers slated to address graduates of USC’s education school dropped out of the ceremony, citing, among other things, the university’s decision to call the LAPD to quell largely peaceful student protesters last week. The move came just days after USC canceled its mainstage graduation ceremony and casts uncertainty on the more than two dozen satellite ceremonies that are still set to run. “To speak at USC in this moment would betray not only our own values, but USC’s too,” the speakers wrote. Jaweed Kaleem / Los Angeles Times 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Other California colleges seem to be faring no better than USC — minus the self-immolation on the part of university leadership. Cal Poly Humboldt abruptly shut down its campus for the rest of the school year as students continue to occupy two buildings. School administrators said the cost of the protest is “ in the millions ” because of vandalism, theft and loss of revenue. Rival factions continue to clash violently at UCLA. Encampments at Stanford and UC Berkeley remain peaceful, though. Aidin Vaziri and August Linton / San Francisco Chronicle 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Some lighter news: A California mountaineer wants to change how people climb Mount Everest. Adrian Ballinger, an Olympic Valley-based mountain guide, is pioneering a technique that promises to cut the trip time in half. The catch: You have to sleep in a suffocating bag for months before your trip. A standard Everest climb can take up to two months as mountaineers adjust to the altitude, but by sleeping in so-called “hypoxic tents” that simulate a lack of oxygen, Ballinger’s clients can acclimate before they even leave their homes. Jack Dolan / Los Angeles Times 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] California grizzly bears have long held a prominent place in the myth of the Western frontier: 19th century accounts alleged that the bears — now extinct in the state — were bigger, meaner and scarier than elsewhere. Turns out that’s just not true. A team of researchers analyzed grizzly bones in museums throughout California and found that the bears were the same height and weight on average as their relatives across the country. “Pretty much everything that I thought I knew about these animals turned out to be wrong,” one of the study’s authors said.

Snow in Downtown Los Angeles would be quite the sight, but it seems like that’s probably not going to happen; check out the LA Times’ map of where snow’s expected to fall this weekend. And now, onto the five USC, LA and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Former Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein was sentenced to 16 years in prison for committing sex crimes in LA County. Weinstein will serve the new sentence on top of a 23-year term stemming from a New York conviction in 2020, more or less ensuring that the 70-year-old will remain behind bars for the rest of his life. Lauren Herstik / The New York Times 2. The LA Metro is looking to increase the number of security officers in its system after a staggering rise in deaths and crime. Already, 21 people have died on Metro trains and buses this year — as many as who died in all of 2022 — one stemming from a homicide, the rest from overdoses. Reported drug use and sales spiked nearly 100% last year, and serious crimes, including aggravated assaults, rose 24%. Rachel Uranga / Los Angeles Times 3. California’s community college system named Sonya Christian to serve as its first female chancellor. Christian, currently chancellor of the Kern Community College District, will also be the first person of South Asian descent to head the 116-campus system that serves 1.8 million students — the nation’s largest system of higher education — come June. Michael Burke / EdSource 4. State Attorney General Rob Bonta launched an investigation into the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department after a “disturbing” rise in deaths in the county jail system. Twenty inmates have died in Riverside jails since January 2022, outpacing other comparable county jail systems. Sheriff Chad Bianco described the move as being politically motivated. Christopher Damien / Desert Sun 5. A group of Stanford professors is railing against a university system that allows students to anonymously report classmates who exhibit discrimination or bias, arguing that it erodes free speech. The university maintains that the system is meant to help students “get along with one another,” while the group of professors likened it to McCarthyism and the East German government encouraging citizens to inform on their neighbors.

I’m sad to share that we’re shutting down College Brief before the new school year begins. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The reality is that we didn’t have the resources to institutionalize the organization: to make sure it didn’t rely on college students in leadership roles like me and Gil Rubinstein, our director of development, spending hundreds of unpaid hours on it. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] We began fundraising in October of last year, and incurred our first expenses in December ahead of our January editorial launch. From then on, we operated on a month-to-month basis, struggling to raise more than a month’s worth of breathing room in the budget. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The Bay Area fundraiser in March was a godsend. It accounted for about half the $19,500 we raised between October 2023 and July 2024, and it allowed us to continue editorial operations through June. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] That event was meant to give us breathing room to apply for grants and search for major donors. But we struggled to continue our momentum, and by May, it was clear we’d need to close a long-shot grant over the summer if we wanted to resume operations in full force once the fall semester began. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Our budget was defined by the fair wage ($20/hr) we promised to pay our staff of eight writers, copy editors and designers. Those staffers worked early mornings to publish a total of 360 newsletters in six months. That content was viewed over 120,000 times by college students who hadn’t regularly read real news before. We executed the mission using what resources we had. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A quick breakdown of expenses: Staff wages (66.6%) Fiscal sponsor and donation transaction fees (13.5%) Program expenses like newsletter software and Google Workspace (12.7%) Marketing and fundraising (7%) p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Compensation for Gil and myself was not a priority. I earned the equivalent of $2.85 per hour, and invested the majority of it back into the project. Gil donated more money to College Brief than he was paid. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] All this meant that we faced a difficult decision when offered jobs elsewhere. (Me, at The San Francisco Standard, and Gil, at a congressional campaign.) p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Our best hope for continuing College Brief was to become profitable from business sponsorships within a year or two, but we struggled to raise the “prove it” capital we needed despite our encouraging metrics. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] We did not want to give up on the organization. Donors and supporters like you generously gave time and money to see College Brief grow. All of you gave serious financial contributions, hours of advice, or vouched for us in your networks. Many did a combination of the three. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Ultimately, our team decided that it was best to shut the project down. Some key staff members, not just Gil and I, were offered opportunities elsewhere. Some had other academic or professional commitments that would’ve prevented them from spending more time on College Brief. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] We’re proud of what we accomplished over College Brief’s nine-month tenure. It meant the world to us that all of you so generously supported the organization. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Thank you for your support of College Brief."},{"slug":"wildfire-erupts-in-riverside-county","title":"Wildfire erupts in Riverside County","date":1698764473000,"web_exclusive":false,"content":"*|MC_PREVIEW_TEXT|* View this email in your browser By Tomoki Chien and Sammy Bovitz Good morning.

Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. A fast-moving fire erupted in Riverside County early Monday afternoon, burning more than 1,200 acres as of Tuesday morning. Officials ordered over 1,100 homes to evacuate, and said strong winds and low humidity brought by Santa Ana winds are to blame for the fire’s quick spread. The blaze was 0% contained as of Tuesday morning, and officials said that it could spread even further once the wind picks up in the midmorning. Claire Moses / The New York Times 2. A viral video posted Thursday night showed two individuals at USC taking down posters of Israeli hostages that’ve been kidnapped by Hamas. When confronted in the video, one of the individuals said that “it’s causing the conflict to be worse.” A Department of Public Safety officer was also filmed taking down posters, though school officials said that removal was in line with general university policy, regardless of the content of the flyers. A USC Jewish leader denounced the removals as “an attempt to erase the value of human beings.” Staff / Annenberg Media 3. Happy Halloween! You’ve probably moved onto things… more adult than candy on the holiday, but know this: California’s children have some of the worst dental health in the United States, ranking 47th out of 51 in a national survey that included D.C. The study found that 14.8% of the state’s children have decayed teeth or cavities, and experts blamed a lack of access to dental care, fluoridated water and fresh fruits and vegetables — particularly in low-income communities — for the poor numbers. Jenny Gold / Los Angeles Times 4. California State University faculty nearly unanimously authorized a strike Monday, giving their union the power to picket should contract negotiations fall through. The union is calling for better pay amidst growing faculty workloads and what the union president called “systematic inequalities.” The university system’s interim chancellor called the salary demands “unreasonable.” If the work stoppage actually occurs, it would be the first system-wide faculty strike in CSU history. Joe Rivano Barros / Mission Local 5. When Gov. Gavin Newsom traveled to China last week to discuss climate policy with America’s greatest foreign adversary, he played hardball — but maybe with the wrong guy. He steamrolled a 10-year-old while playing a game of basketball with a group of schoolchildren. The video, predictably, got a snarky online reception. “Flagrant foul,” Fox News tweeted. Neither Newsom nor the child were hurt, and both got up smiling in the video. Michael R. Blood / Associated Press You’re all caught up. Thanks for reading Morning, Trojan, and have a good day.

If anything good has come out of USC football’s ridiculous suspension of an Orange County Register reporter — more on that later this newsletter — it was this hilarious and off-the-rails column in the Los Angeles Times. It’s a great read. Onto the five USC, LA and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Wildfires are undoing years of progress cutting man-made air pollution and are likely to become an even larger polluter in the future, a Stanford University study found. Though the findings apply across the U.S., the phenomena is particularly dramatic in California and Nevada: Particulate pollution fell 32% from 2000 to 2015 in those states, then jumped 14% from 2016 to 2022. Experts blamed climate change and years of forest mismanagement for the increasing frequency and intensity of the blazes. Paul Rogers / The Mercury News 2. USC football reinstated an Orange County Register reporter’s team access after banning him over what many called minor infractions — like shouting a question after a press conference ended. It was a rather remarkable walk-back for the team, which had doubled down on its decision just the previous day. But it perhaps wasn’t altogether surprising: Bullying journalists in one of the nation’s largest media markets doesn’t seem like a particular recipe for success. This ain’t Oklahoma no more. Tom Moore / San Gabriel Valley Tribune 3. California will allow insurance companies to consider climate change when setting their premiums, a first-in-the-nation effort to keep insurers, who fear heavy losses, from fleeing the wildfire-prone state. The current model doesn’t let companies factor in future risks — only what’s already happened on the property. Seven of the top 12 insurance providers have paused or suspended service in the state in the past year. Adam Beam / Associated Press 4. Expect another soggy Southern California winter, thanks to a persistent El Niño system that experts say will likely linger through 2024. Forecasters say there’s a high chance that the system will become a “strong” El Niño, which will likely translate to a wetter-than-average second half of the winter. Hayley Smith / Los Angeles Times 5. A Central Valley school district is deploying a $1.4 million weapons detection system to screen students before entering campus. Evolv Technology — which is somewhat cagey about how its technology actually works — purports to use a combination of advanced sensors and artificial intelligence to detect weapons in bags and pockets.

Before we begin, I’d like to congratulate my copy editor, Anna Hsu , for getting promoted to a paid copy editing position in the newsroom. I’m also happy to share that I’m the new photo editor at the Daily Trojan. And now, here are the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. A former USC fraternity president asked an LA judge to overturn his 2021 expulsion, claiming the university denied him due process in investigating the sexual misconduct allegations that led to his removal. The petitioner isn’t identified by name in the suit. Bill Hetherman / City News Service 2. Northern California is gearing up for another round of dangerous storms that could bring heavy flooding across the region. President Biden declared a federal emergency early Monday morning, giving the state more resources in managing the aftereffects of the atmospheric river that’s already killed at least 12. Jessica Flores and J.D. Morris / San Francisco Chronicle 3. It’s come at a high cost, but the heavy storms across California are expected to go a long way in recharging the state’s reservoirs. Still, the storms aren’t going to vanish the worst drought in state history, doing little to restore underground aquifers or revive the dying Colorado River. Jake Bittle / Grist 4. Donna Heinel, a former USC athletic department administrator, was sentenced to six months in prison for her role in the Operation Varsity Blues scandal. As a liaison between the university’s coaches and athletic admissions subcommittee, Heinel hoodwinked the committee into approving admission for two dozen phony athletes. Anemona Hartocollis / The New York Times 5. Rep. Kevin McCarthy secured the House speakership after a historic debacle courtesy of GOP holdouts. By winning the speakership, the Bakersfield Republican managed to keep the gavel in California hands — though vastly different hands, at that.

Tomo Chien March 25, 2024 p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Good morning. It’s Monday, and I’m reading about how you can make your trip to LAX suck less . Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] California lawmakers want to invest in the space industry. In a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom, the state’s two senators and 40 representatives wrote that California should woo defense and space contractors — who bring high-paying jobs and economic growth — with lenient tax credits. The state, which was instrumental in putting men on the moon, already houses heavyweights like Boeing, Northrop Grumman, NASA and SpaceX. But California’s space industry has long been in decline. Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman have relocated elsewhere, and just last month, NASA laid off almost a tenth of its Pasadena laboratory. Staff / Los Angeles Daily News 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Progressives could reshape the LA City Council after notching wins in the midterms. Three so-called super progressives, including incumbent Nithya Raman, will have the opportunity to expand the council’s progressive bloc from three to five members if they win in the November general election. That’d mean a third of the council would be deeply progressive, which could, given a handful of left-of-center swing votes, dramatically shift the city’s stance on things like homelessness, public transit and the size of the police department. David Zahniser / Los Angeles Times 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Earlier this month , a Compton couple blew out a tire driving over one of their neighborhood’s glaring potholes. So they visited a Home Depot and started fixing it themselves. Neighbors, long frustrated with the area’s state of disrepair, showered them with thanks and donated around $2,000 that allowed the couple to repair 38 potholes. But not everybody was so thankful. Last week, city officials sent the couple a cease and desist letter, noting that DIY fixes to city property are illegal and that they raise liability concerns. “They feel embarrassed. Because they feel that we have put them on blast,” the couple said. Caitlin Hernández / LAist 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] You can once again take the scenic train through San Clemente after crews repaired a stretch of tracks damaged by a January landslide. Full service resumes today for Metrolink’s segment between San Clemente and Oceanside and Amtrak’s popular Pacific Surfliner to San Diego. The closure was the fifth time in just three years that hillside erosion has shut down rail service in the region, including a six-month closure in 2022. This time around, crews erected a 200-foot wall to buttress the slope above the tracks with $7.2 million in emergency funding. Teresa Watanabe / Los Angeles Times 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Lego asked a Southern California police department to stop photoshopping mugshots with the company’s signature plastic heads. Last week, the Murrieta Police Department made headlines when it started covering photos of suspects with Lego heads to comply with a new state law that limits police from publishing certain mugshots on social media. Lego, clearly, was unimpressed, but Murrieta police didn’t seem particularly discouraged. “We are currently exploring other methods to continue publishing our content in a way that is engaging and interesting to our followers,” said a police department spokesperson.

Here are the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. Brace yourselves: This latest winter storm will continue to pummel California on Wednesday. Officials issued flood advisories for LA County through Tuesday night while 50 mph gusts were detected near the coast. At least one person died in Northern California after wind toppled a tree that fell onto a vehicle. Diana Leonard and Jason Samenow / The Washington Post 2. USC will scrap its coronavirus vaccine mandate next academic year for students, faculty and staff. Current campus vaccination rates sit near 100% for the primary series and 85% for the booster. University officials said they’d like to distribute Paxlovid — which was endorsed by the Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for the virus — to high-risk people with mild symptoms. Claire Qiu / Daily Trojan 3. LA Unified School District campuses will remain closed for a second day as workers continue striking for better pay. District workers began picketing as early as 5 a.m. on Tuesday morning and gathered in the thousands for an afternoon rally downtown, but have yet to schedule new talks with district leadership. Staff / Los Angeles Times 4. Mexican cartels have long been a source of American drug woes. Now, there’s a new kid on the block: Chinese investors, owners and workers are becoming increasingly involved in illegal marijuana production in states like California. It’s still unclear how involved organized crime syndicates are and whether the Communist Party is involved at all, though. Natalie Fertig / Politico 5. A bill floated in the state legislature could ban Skittles, Hot Tamales and Dubble Bubble Twist Gum — because all the treats contain potentially harmful chemicals. The bill, proposed by Assemblyman Jesse Gabriel (D-Woodland Hills), would ban all foods that contain Red Dye No. 3, titanium dioxide, potassium bromate, brominated vegetable oil or propyl paraben.

Onto the five USC, LA and California stories you need to know for today. 1. California workers will get a minimum of five paid sick days per year starting January, under a new law signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom. Workers were previously only guaranteed three. The bill is a win for labor advocates, who just last week lost an effort to give unemployment benefits to striking workers but won a $20 minimum wage for fast food employees. Critics were quick to argue that many small businesses won’t be able to absorb the costs of the new requirement. Sophie Austin and Trân Nguyễn / Associated Press 2. More than 75,000 Kaiser Permanente workers took to the picket line Wednesday, initiating the largest healthcare worker strike in U.S. history. Kaiser and union negotiators failed to reach a deal in a marathon bargaining session in San Francisco the day before, but remain in talks. The union represents workers in five states and the District of Columbia, but more than 90% of its members work in California facilities. The strike is expected to end Saturday morning. Kristen Hwang / CalMatters 3. LA retail businesses will soon be required to accept cash payments, a departure from pandemic-era policy when many stopped accepting physical currency. The motion passed unanimously through the city council and is now waiting to be written up by the city attorney. Councilmember Heather Hutt cited inclusion and accessibility while introducing the motion, as many senior citizens, low income communities of color, young people and domestic violence survivors often use cash or are unable to access credit and debit cards. Makenna Sievertson / LAist 4. California Republicans lost a vital lifeline when Rep. Kevin McCarthy was ousted from the House speakership. The Bakersfield representative — who strategists described as a “phenomenal fundraiser and phenomenal recruiter” — said he won’t run for the speakership again, leaving his Republican colleagues to gear up for an election without one of their biggest assets. Lara Korte and Dustin Gardiner / Politico 5. LA Metro nixed a plan that would’ve armed the police officers who patrol its transit lines with a lasso-type weapon called the BolaWrap. The device, which was approved by the LA Police Commission in August, fires a Kevlar cord meant to allow officers to non-lethally subdue their targets. Metro board members, who’ve previously looked to stop over-policing on the transit lines, called the weapon “a step in the wrong direction.” Nathan Solis / Los Angeles Times You’re all caught up.

Hope you didn’t miss us too much. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. 1. The worst of Tropical Storm Hilary is expected to pass LA by Monday, ending a record-breaking deluge that seemed to largely spare USC and the surrounding community of widespread flooding Sunday. Arid desert regions like the Antelope Valley are experiencing severe flash floods and could still experience more, but no California deaths have yet been reported. Jacob Margolis / LAist 2. USC is installing new electric vehicle charging stations, bringing the total number to just under 250 across both campuses once the project completes in September. The stations are run by ChargePoint, which charges 25 cents per kilowatt hour while charging. An on-campus EV parking permit costs $396, around $100 cheaper than a traditional permit. Taylor Marie Contarino / Annenberg Media 3. There was a storm — then a quake. A 5.1 magnitude earthquake with an epicenter just southeast of Ojai struck Sunday afternoon, sending a series of aftershocks through Southern California. People in downtown LA reported feeling the quake, though no significant damage was reported across the state. Thomas Fuller and Soumya Karlamangla / The New York Times 4. Three police officers in the Northern California city of Antioch could soon face life in prison for brutal civil rights violations dating four years back, including bragging about siccing a K-9 dog on mostly Black suspects and sharing photos of suspects’ wounds after shooting them with projectile guns. One officer is accused of saying “I want to plug him” before shooting a suspected car thief with his hands up. Ethan Baron / The Mercury News 5. Not everyone seemed concerned about Sunday’s tropical storm. As businesses sandbagged doorways and Angelenos cleared grocery aisles, surfers flocked to the beaches to ride — as opposed to ride out — the storm. “We were kind of excited because there hasn’t been very many waves for like months,” one surfer said. “Hopefully, it picks up in the next couple of days.” Lilly Nguyen and Andrew Turner / Daily Pilot You’re all caught up.

It’s Thursday, and I’m stoked to bike to class today in the rain. And then again next week, in worse rain . Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Your rent could go up starting today, thanks to the end of pandemic-era rent freezes. Bear with me here. If you live in rent-controlled housing — generally anything built before October 1978, which makes up about 75% of the city’s housing stock — your rent can go up by 4% annually. If your landlord pays your gas and electricity bills, that number goes up to 6%. Go to this link , plug in your address, open the “Housing” tab and look at the “Rent Stabilization Ordinance” field to see whether your apartment is rent-controlled. There’s a long list of caveats and exceptions to all of this: Click the article linked below for the details. David Wagner / LAist 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Zuck got grilled. Washington lawmakers hauled an impressive roster of California tech executives to a Senate hearing yesterday — ostensibly to question them about their commitment to child safety on social media platforms — and reserved their harshest criticism for Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta. One senator accused Zuckerburg of having “blood on his hands” in reference to teen suicides linked to Instagram use, and another said Zuckerberg is “wandering around in the foothills of creepy” by collecting users’ personal data to inform Meta’s algorithms. Diego Mendoza / Semafor 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] California lawmakers unveiled a slate of reparations bills that call for the state to restore property seized in “race-based” cases of eminent domain and a potentially unconstitutional measure to fund programs for specific groups based on race, gender and sexual orientation. Notably, the proposals don’t include calls to directly compensate descendants of Black slaves with cash. The bills will likely face a steep battle in the state Legislature — never mind their potential legal troubles. Lara Korte / Politico 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Twenty-five California counties sued Tesla, claiming the electric vehicle giant is mishandling hazardous waste at its facilities. The lawsuit, which includes LA County, alleges that Tesla fails to label dangerous waste like brake fluid, used batteries, antifreeze and diesel fuel, then sends it to landfills that can’t accept hazardous material. This isn’t Tesla’s first go. In 2019, the company settled with the Environmental Protection Agency over alleged federal hazardous waste violations at its Fremont factory. Steve Dent / Engadget 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] California lawmakers love to introduce bills that probably won’t pass — if you read this newsletter every day, you probably already know that. But sometimes, lawmakers say, passing the bill isn’t the point. “I used to always introduce what I call ‘diarrhea bills,’ to give people a heart attack or to just try to get attention on an issue,” said one former lawmaker. That’s great. Good for them. Here’s the catch: The diarrhea isn’t free. It costs roughly $30,000 in taxpayer money to get a single bill from introduction to passage, because a whole roster of paid staff needs to draft and analyze the legislation.

It’s Friday, and I’m reading the schedule for this weekend’s Festival of Books: protest included. Onto the five USC, Los Angeles and California stories you need to know for today. Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A report found that the average USC student makes a decent, OK, pretty good return on investment from their university degree. The report — which has its flaws, but is nonetheless one of the better datasets available — says the typical USC graduate earns a $170,000 return on investment 10 years after graduation. UCLA grads earn $211,000; Harvard, $275,000; and Stanford, $360,000. But compare that to the California Institute of the Arts, where graduates typically lose $116,000. Staff / Bloomberg 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Some 300 protesters marched through campus yesterday, decrying USC’s decision to bar its valedictorian from speaking at graduation — the first large demonstration in response to what has become the latest flashpoint in the domestic conflict over the Israel-Hamas war. In other news: USC’s top lawyer said in a faculty senate meeting that the uproar caused by the decision to cancel the speech “ was not unanticipated .” University leadership remained mum when asked to elaborate on the safety concerns it cited when it made the call. Staff / Los Angeles Times 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] An activist group said it gathered enough signatures to place a tough-on-crime measure on the November ballot. The measure would repeal a controversial California initiative called Proposition 47, which lowered penalties for low-level drug possession and property crimes in an effort to reduce overcrowding in state prisons. Critics say Prop. 47 has led to runaway theft and addiction — though the statistics don’t necessarily support that claim. John Woolfolk / The Mercury News 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Speaking of things you should look out for in November: A measure that could crack down on corruption in LA’s scandal-plagued City Hall is winding its way toward the ballot. A city committee approved the new rules — which double penalties for violations of the city’s ethics code, tighten conflict of interest rules and protect the independence of the city Ethics Commission — and will now send them to the full City Council. If approved, the measure will sit on the November ballot for your consideration. Staff / City News Service 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art — world-renowned for paintings from artists like Andy Warhol and Jackson Pollock — just started selling bongs in its gift shop. But these aren’t your everyday pipes. The ceramic devices look more like museum pieces than something to smoke out of, and the gift shop, apparently, doesn’t sell the requisite weed (bo-ring). They also retail for as much as $195. “We currently sell bar items quite well and, this being San Francisco, thought we could make room for cannabis accessories,” the store’s buyer said.

Support this newsletter 1. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] A new state proposal could make your electricity bills cheaper. Right now, the pricing structure is straightforward: The more power you use, the more you pay. But that means some people get stuck with soaring bills in the summer when they have no choice but to crank up the AC. The new model would set a base fee of $24 every month, but offset that fixed cost with a much lower rate per kilowatt hour of electricity. That could save people in the hottest parts of the state up to $33 a month in the summer, but increase bills for people in more temperate climates. Adam Beam / Associated Press 2. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] USC unveiled its new Dramatic Arts Building in a ribbon-cutting ceremony yesterday. The facility is a renovation of one of the oldest buildings on campus — which used to be the United University Church — that preserves its historic Romanesque Revival-style exterior. The building sits across the street from the Thornton School of Music on the northernmost block of campus and features two theaters, rehearsal rooms, a media space with a green screen, vocal practice rooms and a professional development center. Caleb Kim and Halo Lyman / Daily Trojan 3. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] South LA is bracing for rising food prices next week, when California’s new $20 fast-food minimum wage takes effect. Roughly 4 in 10 South LA residents have limited access to affordable and healthy food because they don’t live near a grocery store, which leaves fast food to fill the gaps in daily nutrition. But restaurants say they plan to hike menu prices next week to offset the cost of the new minimum wage, which will leave people in one of the region’s poorest communities paying more to eat. Daniel Miller / Los Angeles Times 4. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Two people were killed in Jefferson Park when a sedan traveling at 100 mph smashed into a parked UPS truck, possibly sending itself airborne before colliding with several other vehicles. The two victims were passengers in the sedan, and the driver attempted to flee the scene but was run down by several good Samaritans. Police said the driver could face murder charges — particularly because he may have been under the influence of narcotics. The crash adds to a trend of rising traffic fatalities in the city. Josh DuBose / KTLA 5. p span[style*=\"font-size\"] Skiing in California has gotten a lot more dangerous. Ski-related emergency room visits soared by 50% between 2016 and 2022, while the number of people on the slopes remained essentially unchanged: suggesting there’s some new factor causing the accidents. Former ski patrollers and hospital staff blamed a growing culture of debauchery — drinking, taking drugs and filming social media content — on the slopes for the noticeably worse accidents. “People are just checked out,” one nurse said.
